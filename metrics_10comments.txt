&gt;those are the real racists.
as i cited malcolm x above, he was also pretty critical of white liberals, too. he makes a pretty cogent argument, as well. basically: white liberals get votes by saying shit is gunna change and it never does. i agree with that. but i don't buy the fox news argument that liberals are the "real racists." it has no empirical evidence, and imo it's just fox news trying to make themselves not look like all of the shit they promote doesn't protect the white, christian, male, heterosexual, cisgender, able-bodied, upper-class status quo, when in reality it does.
&gt;i don't need somebody that has never stepped foot in the ghetto, never been a minority
many proponents of these policies have.
&gt;not laws that enable us to keep up this vicious cycle of poverty, and thus, crime. it's done nothing but make people reliant and complacent.
with the way that welfare is run currently, yeah it does create a vicious cycle. yeah, there needs to be more of an angle of empowerment, although from those that i've talked to and been around, i don't get a sense of people being complacent as much as a sense of stuck in the vicious cycle.
&gt;what we need is to break the chains of contempt
how do we do this, then?
dude... the number decreases, the reaction time increases, your patronizing me when you're wrong... and you're making yourself look bad

i didn't know that, and i wouldn't know these were tennis players if it wasn't in the title. 
also i didn't think about cream when i first read the title. i thought, "i eat it in one bite, do some people cut it up?"
scotland is part of the uk. but there's always a joke that goes around that when he wins, he's british but when he loses he's scottish.

eh still the champ until someone else wins, just like spain is still the wc holder.
that sort of inexcusable ignorance can haunt you for life, my friend.  he was right to delete the comment before future employers and/or spouses could see it.
i thought they were wondering what process they took to consume the strawberries. i was gonna say i separate the leaves and eat everything else.
and pretty funny
i've worked in the service industry for my whole working life. i disagree that there is no excuse for not tipping. i am extremely polite to servers and service people because of my own experiences. when i go out to a restaurant i tip 20% if you are nice and do your job. i tip 15% if we have problems with the order. if you are rude and we have problems with the order, then i'll blow you up and you can forget about a tip. shoot, i tip on to go orders because i realize how important tips are. 
warren sapp said the server was very rude to them, etc. he met the story head on. i have no reason to believe he's a liar.
the point is if you're outright rude to me, which you must admit we have all experienced, then i'm not going to give you extra money because i'm obliged.
yeah i had no clue. i just thought it was one of those questions asked in those "what's your favorite yada yada" segments
yeah man, you never hear them mentioned like you do the alex rider books. i never liked other spy books that much, but i really liked the characters in cherub. still got the em sitting in my room at 19 years old. fancy a nostalgic re-read now :)

look, just because i can't think of another example of something that changes consistency and flavour when you process it doesn't mean they aren't different things.
i guess steak vs mince? you wouldn't put a steak in your pie, you would put mince in there. 
whipped cream and cream might be the same thing, but there is still a significant difference. you can't put cream on top of a drink as decoration for example.

darn, hate getting caught. nice one haha
i don't think it's exclusively a british thing, but it a common occurrence here, especially around wimbledon, as served traditionally with cream. 
though i don't like strawberries, so there's that.
that sounds gross.  i was thinking whipped cream.
he got it wrong too. every food is eaten with mouth. you just put it in the mouth with fingers.

because this is the third time in a row he has done it. each time he does it, he plays it down shrugs it off and makes like it's no big deal. he has already been suspended twice for it, and those were wrist slaps. he has no reason to believe that they would actually punish him for it.

so, he gets to use this incredibly intimidating tactic on anyone, while potentially injuring those people, knowing that no one will do anything about it.
this is about the next person in some sports league who thinks he can injure people just for the psychological impact it will have on their opponent.

i don't think it's witty; i'm pretty sure this is how most people would have answered.

you eat shit with strawberries?!

reagan really screwed [patco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/professional_air_traffic_controllers_organization_%281968%29) and started a downward spiral for labor unions in this country.  [see dailykos.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/09/1107835/-remembering-reagan-s-sweet-little-lie-to-the-air-traffic-controllers)  he may have helped the airline industry with his burial of patco--but he definitely didn't make it safer.
edit:  arguably helped*
you used it correctly. you are correct that fancy is often used ironically a lot now though, because being "fancy" is not trendy anymore. americans think of pompous and unnecessary things when we think "fancy".
i don't think he did it on purpose, as a british person i didn't understand the question either, i would have answered the same way.

you put some bacon on that bread.

you put even more bacon on that bread.

how would the question sound if the answer should be "with cream" ?
there is also a chance he didn't want 55 messages all stating the same exact thing. 
god bless kentucky.
if you like balsamic vinegar try this for a quick, fairly healthy, cheap and easy breakfast:
* get a cheap but nice loaf (i.e. 70p unsliced tiger bread or something).
* cut up a few slices.
* half some cherry tomatoes and put them on.
* drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
* add a good twist of sea salt and black pepper to each slice.
* enjoy with a look of pure indulgence.

do you use any other food products when eating strawberries?
i love that! i often make tomato, basil, mozzarella, &amp; balsamic salad, but your way on bread sounds delicious. i have tomatoes and basil growing in the garden so its extra delicious this time of year. thanks! 
uncouth american here as well.  as i was reading each response i was like "wtf, why are they saying with cream?  is that the joke?  is this dirty innuendo?" then i got to the last guy and was like "ok, there you go, this guy gets it," only to realize after that he was supposed to be the oddball.
well yeah makes sense half the games in brazil are during rain
that doesn't appear to be clotted cream though, unless it has melted in that hot english heat you always hear about...
ok, so, i don't really keep up with the hippity hop these days, but i *do* know that weird al has a parody song on his upcoming album (mandatory fun in stores july 15th, fyi) called "handy" and after googling it appears to be a spoof of a song by a british female pop artist titled "fancy".  people are messing with you as a reference to that song.

&gt;don't take the words too literally. look for the spirit behind the language. else you might miss the point of a lot of things. this isn't a scientific journal, it's a casual thread in a sports sub page of an entertainment website.
i agree with this concept.  however, like i said before, i'm not a mind reader.  many times, the only way to figure out the spirit of what someone said is to question them or to counter points they've made.
if someone says something that doesn't hold water (i.e. this thing that is top 10% in the world is average) and you call them out, they can do one of two things.  
admit that it was poor word choice and didn't really reflect their views and then clarify what you really meant.
or take the stance that you meant what you said in the first place and that everyone else are the ones with the problem.
if he had done the first, i think we would have been in complete agreement and moved on after 1-2 posts.
instead, he wanted to be obstinate, dig in his heels, and double down on a stance that isn't supportable by any rational definition of the word "average". 
he is free to do that, but then the issue isn't that i am unwilling to look at the spirit of his message.  the issue is that he would rather double down on something that isn't actually his message as opposed to admitting his initial word choice was shit.
i'm not sure how that is on me.  i can only go on what you say.  if you say something that doesn't hold water as stated and i call you on it, and you say over and over that it does hold water, then all i can do is assume that it is in fact your actual message, no matter how stupid it is.

but this question gives us a pool of our pro athletes to choose from. assuming hypothetically that they would grow up playing soccer and training for that. the freak athletes have an edge on the younger crowd, now if they devoted their talent to soccer then it's possible. but this is a hypothetical situation, so we make a list of top athletes that fit the bill.

neymar is no where near big enough to play anything but kicker and punter. and i'd imagine he would be great at it. and we are asking which athletes from brazil could play in the nfl, not which undersized soccer player. anderson silva could've played in the league if he played growing up and had the skill set.  but neymar doesn't make the cut. too small.
messi isn't a freak athlete. he really isn't. ronaldo is big for soccer, but puny compared to athletes in the nfl

i am not arguing that there is no reason to buy their products; i'm arguing that there is no reason to try to legally ban emerging technologies out of fear for an industry player's profit margins.

even if you were to argue that there is no reason to pay for something you can download for free - some players in the industry actually often manage to disprove this by doing things right. buying games on steam, for example, is often more convenient than pirating them, and offers other advantages as well (save-games stored in the cloud etc).

ah, no thread that mentions guns is complete without some sort of reference to regulating bullets.

==============================	
good on anonvas for analyzing this. i’ll point out a few initial considerations and issues i think are relevant when considering this act: 


**supreme court.** the filipino supreme court has not yet ruled on whether to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the implementation of this law. although the court convened, they want more time to review petitions, and they will apparently issue a decision next tuesday (october 9, 2012). that’s important because the supreme court’s decision will have the effect of law and can stop this act from being implemented. we need to wait for them to make a decision before anything else can be done. however, until then, the act may be and likely is enforceable.   [source](http://www.philstar.com/article.aspx?articleid=855169&amp;publicationsubcategoryid=63)


**caselaw.** it would be useful to see what kind of standards are applied for libel cases similar to those that may occur online. these would be cases involving newspapers, magazines, open letters, as well as private communications, and more specifically, any case involving article 355 since the act specifically refers to that article in reference to libel. also important, what case law exists for the standards to be applied? libel, as defined in article 353 of the penal code, is only the starting point in determining defamation. the whole of title thirteen, chapter one of the penal code deals with libel and should be read as a whole. the philippines have a civil law system, so caselaw is not as important- but, courts apparently follow the supreme court’s decisions as stare decisis. so any cases dealing with the standards applied to libel should be evaluated.  


**criminal/civil procedure.** the philippines have a civil law system and certainly have their own unique criminal and civil procedure. i’m not familiar with filipino legal procedure at all, but it’s important to consider it in relation to this act. the act states in several places “any person found guilty...” (see, e.g., sec. 8 penalities). now, the questions of how and when a person is found guilty hinge directly on the form of criminal procedure in place. for example... what standards do police use/need to arrest a person? what rights do citizens have to an attorney once arrested? how do filipino police departments process new cases?  
technology politics
==============================	


**international law.** article ii, section 2 of the philippine constitution expressly provides that filipino law adopts “generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.” [source.](http://www.chanrobles.com/article2.htm#.ugspxjhjjj0) the cyber crime act is targeting information and data on the internet. the internet, obviously, isn’t some self-contained thing that is purely a domestic matter. that means other nations *should* have an interest in this law. if the filipino supreme court does nothing, and the act is put into place as is, there will likely be some backfire from other nations. that’s where international law may play a part. while chapter vi, section 22 (international cooperation) of the act is probably meant to expand investigatory power, in a way, it might limit the act’s full potential. consider that section 22 gives “full force and effect” to “all relevant international instruments...” and put that in conjunction with article ii of the constitution. this should give the international community room to negotiate or challenge the act- that is, if anyone in the international community cares. but i believe an act of this type, with such heavy restrictions and expansive coercive powers, should give other nations pause for concern. 


**warrants.** the warrant requirement serves as a check on the office of cybercrime. as anonvas pointed out, all traffic data can be “intercepted” without a warrant. and only “due cause” is needed... who knows what that standard is, probably pretty flexible and open. for a warrant, however, the last paragraph of section 12 of the act (real-time collection of traffic data) sets out the requisites for obtaining a warrant. note that all three of those enumerated requirements must be met in order for a warrant to be obtained. but also note how easy it will probably be to meet those three requirements: (1) “reasonable grounds” (which sounds like an exceptionally open and liberal standard) for any past, present, or future violation of the act; (2) reasonable grounds that the evidence sought is essential for conviction or prevention of crime under the act; (3) and no other way to get the evidence. in my view, that’s a distressing standard. 


it should not be taken for granted how much power the office of cybercrime has once they get a warrant. look at section 15 as well as the definition for “interception” under section 3. put those together and it means that if the police have a warrant, among other things, they can: physically take your computer, make copies of everything on your computer, render your network inaccessible, as well as directly surveil and record (copy) any communication on your computer that is made over internet.   

technology politics
==============================	

**actual practice.** the philippines may have a fully functioning government that is efficiently run, without corruption, and protective of its citizens. but they would be unique in the world if they do have such a government. with that said, the actual practice of law officials and the implementation of the law at the case-level makes a big difference here. because cyber law is a relatively new field, many governments are already doing the things detailed in this act. what this law does is to institutionalize, formalize, and legitimize those actions. the big question now is how will this law be used in practice? will it be a coercive tool used to suppress criticism? or will it be used to track malicious hackers and spammers? who knows- i’ve only seen one instance (not fully verified) of an alleged threat from a police officer's (or a department’s) facebook page. so yes, there is potential for corruptive use of this act, however, actual practice must be taken into account.


if there are more specific questions about what this law does and what the implications are, i'm sure i could look more into it later. for now, just wanted to give some observations.


*the above are only opinions and in no way should be construed as legal advice or interpretation intended to aid in any way a legal matter concerning this act and is purely intended as educational and academic.

bingo, that last sentence rings so much truer than you could ever imagine. it's really hard to understand and those who do understand don't talk about it for fear of the repercussions. we love our culture it defines us by one set of standards and we feel a sense of belonging and unity within it, yet we slightly resent it for the very same reasons because we are a country with a variety of people who are all defined under one set standards, whether we believe them or not. this is partly the reason we are fighting amongst ourselves. as for criticizing catholicism, i think it just depends on the filipino because not all are that devout. . .

the problem for mr. wilson is that with his setup, he has the ability to produce a gun per day or several guns per day on industrial equipment.  "common sense" tells you that this is much more like a "guns for sale" setup rather than a home hobbyist.  (there is also the issue that he appears to have "outside investors" in the project which makes it look even more like a commercial manufacturing set-up - they may technically expect nothing in return for the money (i don't know one way or the other) but it's a "common sense" reason for the atf to look at this situation skeptically.)

i'm sure that underpinning what is going on is a desire to push back disruptive technology, and i sure as hell don't understand the legal issues.  but i'd say that there is enough very real "gray area" to make "putting the brakes" on this project seem not unreasonable.
which you can already do with a cnc machine for less money, but most criminals would rather buy a stolen or illegally imported gun for $200 on the street then pay $20,000 for a 3d printer to make a single shot gun.
yes, lumen equivalence.  in the united states people are used to incandescent bulbs and know that 100 watts is "really bright" and 40 watts is "moderately bright" but couldn't tell you how many lumens those lights put out.  so our cfls and leds are all rated as an equivalent to an incandescent wattage (in addition to lumens).

(i read that comment saying: ship it with spare parts!!?). i see the 3d printing parts as being useful in a long-run: it would be brilliant for vintage synths (usually bought used and not having all original accessories). parts are often hard to get; sometimes discontinued. if manufacturers don't want to service their old merchandise, they can just leave it in the hands of the consumers. i've seen the future and it's diy
so you're saying that this guy is only using this equipment for nefarious reasons?  
i do the exact same thing. i mostly gave up using tediore weapons after i kept wasting 10 shotgun rounds after firing one shot because of reloading since the gun killed most enemies in one shot. the only exception was a pistol which was so powerful i could reload it after one shot and one-hit full health goliaths on the same level :)

great idea, but i'm too used to reloading after engagements to make any real use of it outside of specialist situations.

as a guy who somewhat and unfortunately specializes in the harmful effects of rf radio waves i just need to get this off my chest.

to everyone who thinks that they are getting “nuked” by these power meters: 

you are all fucking morons.  you better not have a god damned microwave oven or fucking toaster oven or anything with a motor in it  in your house if you so fucking worried about getting “nuked”.  stop buying pos “emf fog meters” in an attemt to prove that i’m wrong.  
technology music
==============================	

ah  sorry /rant.  

yeah the meters are fine.  although i once had the pleasure of seeing a family literally rip apart the inside wall of their house so they could put tin foil in to protect themselves from the meter.  

guess i should have said "to make a statement that these printers will never be able to make something" instead of "can't" meaning currently.

currently, i completely agree, the materials aren't ready.  

i restore sailboats and build a lot of carbon fiber and fiberglass/epoxy parts.  i also work with machinists and a lot of what we do is replace heavy metal parts with lighter vacuum molded objects.  
technology music
==============================	
why is it such an idiotic idea? or, to ask it in a different way, how would you go about ensuring that *everyone* in the world with a 3d printer will agree to not make that one thing, and get them to stick to it?
it's your opinion  there is no sales figures or data on this at all if someone does not agree with your opinion  that is their choice it is not logical or factual unless you base it on something. look seriously people will disagree with you at points get over it it is not a problem they have now act like an adult and accept that we do not agree.

glad you find it interesting. no worries about the questions. dog may have gotten started because he wanted the attention, but i don't know. there is a bondsman in my city that tries to do the same thing by giving ride alongs to reporters and getting his face on tv. the thing about dog is that he has a certain look which may have made him modestly successful where he originally was. then someone in the tv business was on vacation and saw him or saw him on tv, then thought they could do something with it. maybe dog hired an agent to get him noticed, i don't really know what got him his break. 
technology politics
==============================	

he may or may not know better. the cynical side in me says that he doesn't and this is how he is. my positive side believes that he knows what he's doing and the producers are pushing an image, which he runs with because he makes a lot of money off of it. i think by this point we all know that reality tv is anything but. 

many people want to be cops, but can't because they don't have the mental or physical abilities. other times, cops become bondsmen because they can make far more money doing it than being cops, plus they have connections in the police department to help them. one of the top bondsman in my city is an ex sheriff and he does very well.

i'm not familiar with dog's legal status, but in my state, you can't have a felony and be a bondsman without getting special permission from the department of insurance. it depends on the charge really. someone convicted for breach of trust isn't going to get one, but someone with perhaps a felony dui would probably qualify. 

many of those criminals aren't bad people. they have reasons for being in trouble, whether drugs, socio-economic issues, etc. there is kind of an honor amongst thieves. that and it helps to have a relationship with a bondsman for when you get in trouble in the future. my boss had a couple of clients that were second generation with him, both parent and child got in trouble and used him. most will actually pay too if you set up some kind of payment plan. we even had one where his wife came in an finished paying after he was convicted and sent to prison. many of these people aren't "bad people", they've just made dumb choices. also many aren't the brightest bulb on the tree, which goes to explaining how they got where they are. i would put dog on the lower end closer to the shady types than at the pinnacle of the industry, but he seems to run a legitimate business. he just doesn't do it in the best way based on what i have seen. what you see on tv and what happens in real life are two different things though. 

i've never felt my life was in danger, but i also stayed away from things like attempted murder, armed robbery, rape, etc. i may have cut out some of the higher bonds and money, but i also went home every night. the type to do stuff like that also tended to be the ones that tilted towards sociopathy, while most of the other stuff was just dumb decisions. 
technology politics
==============================	

i never saw or heard about anyone doing anything but run, but every decade or so, someone in my city gets killed trying to capture someone. it's not always the shady types though, it happens to good ones. the risk is higher than your average person, but there are steps you can take like i described in earlier posts that can help limit and minimize those risks. i value my life over $100,000. i'd rather let someone get away than die trying to capture them. 

self defense doesn't work when you bust into someones house. you're the intruder. that's why i was saying it's best to let the cops do stuff like that since that is their job and the law is on their side when the person has a warrant. they also have the training that most people lack. all the civil and criminal laws still apply to a bail bondsman picking someone up, although there tend to be laws that allow a little more leeway. but again, much of this rests on a case decided well over 100 years ago. the best way is to limit your risks and don't write sketchy bonds. from the cases i have read about, if a bondsman goes in and things go south, he or she would likely be civilly and potentially criminally liable. 

an example would be i heard about one bondsman who got sued when he went to pick someone up. she came willingly and they handcuffed her. as they were walking her down the steps to the car, she tripped and fell. she hurt her leg and ended up getting a few thousand from the bondsman. because she was restrained when being led out, the bondsman was responsible for her safety. now personally, this is very reasonable if you ask me, which is why it pays to be very careful when you pick someone up. the cops however have legal immunity from something like this where it wasn't done intentionally. 

we've had federal marshals call us about someone we had on bond and the feds wanted to make new charges on them. we would give them all our info, and help them find the person if they asked.

believe it or not, given the "debate" here, i actually did return and read the whole thing to see if *any* of my questions would be answered (or if *anything* of interest/use was present).  they were not, and the article was about something completely different (smart media consumption).  hence my annoyance and eye-rolling.  but it did kill time while my code was compiling, i will give it that.  

now i will return to the ether in search of science news (which actually i read for fun) or political news (yes, my one guilty pleasure, but i'd like to think it makes me a slightly more informed voter, for what that's worth).  oddly enough, i'm just not that interested in side-boob or celebrity gossip.  could be that i don't have cable . . . oh, and i do read al jazeera or bbc on when i run out of relevant reddit-links.  but i suppose mr. johnson wouldn't approve of me being informed about the middle east or world affairs.

technology programming
==============================	

big-endian and little-endian refer to the order in which large numbers are stored in memory, analogous to whether you write today's date "10/2" or "2/10".  some cpus are called bi-endian if they can support either.

most powerpc chips are big-endian, and also have a "pseudo" little-endian mode (which was mostly normal little-endian, with some caveats when interfacing with external i/o devices).  mac os has always run powerpc chips in big-endian mode.

intel x86 and x64 are little-endian.  (not surprisingly, microsoft windows also ran in little-endian mode when on powerpc and other bi-endian processors, like mips and itanium.)

microsoft used to have a mac version of virtualpc, a virtual machine that let the user run x86 software, including windows, on their mac.  this program used the little-endian mode of the powerpc, naturally.

apple's "powerpc g5" chips (the ibm powerpc 970 series) dropped support for the g4's little-endian mode.  thus, for a time, microsoft's virtualpc wouldn't run at all on apple's newest macs.

for the downloading if games and music, the only thing i wish i would see is especially for games the ability to "lend" or "give" to a friend. thereby you would not be able to play it while they "have" it and in the case of lending, if you have a stubborn friend, you can revoje their access to it and take it back.

i still stand by the notion that i would *never* attempt to use a firearm printed by a 3d printer. i've asserted this in a number of other threads about plastic printed weapons, and i consider it absurd that people are that scared of them for that reason.

there is nothing to suggest that this man would be producing for the intent of selling the fire arms, at best it's r&amp;d to eventually move into weapons manufacturing. more reasonably, this is a hobbyist experimenting with the possibility of creating his own custom fire arms (which is not against the law).

the most reasonable explanation is this:
technology programming
==============================	

the manufacturer of the 3d printer is avoiding potential liability by assuming that what this man manufactures will (intentionally or not) hurt people.

the atf is eyeballing him to make sure that what he manufactures does not get sold.

in both of those cases i feel actions are reasonable and justifiable. the long term implications of these decisions and actions will develop future policy for 3d printing, so we'll see a very interesting new segment of law surrounding the printing and manufacturing of "controlled" devices from 3d printers.

"*certain counties in florida require background checks on all private sales of handguns at gun shows.*"

[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_shows_in_the_united_states)
i'll bite my tongue and forget that you're accusing law abiding citizens of being illegal arms dealers on the side, and respond as if you weren't just so insulting.
technology politics
==============================	

so lets see.  your solution is "require background checks on _all_ the sales!", but what is the problem?  it seems the problem as you sarcastically described in your earlier comment is that of private sales allowing firearms dealers to avoid background checks.  

that "problem" is not well thought out though.  if a dealer is just going to lie and say that a sale is a private sale to get around a background check, then why would they not simply just lie and say the sale never occurred?  they could even file the serial numbers off and give a full-package illegal sale.  all you'd be doing by requiring background checks on private sales is force them to use a better and more effective lie...
you stated it was difficult therefore admitting it is possible .... you do not seem rational
yes and no. maybe for you it is but for me i'm quite familiar with a few 3d packages i could make a neat automatic gun fitting in my shirt. something you can't even with a hacksaw. the benefit is that i may not have the knowledge of the engineering involved in building a gun but i do have sufficient knowledge about the software in the future required to do this. also i really can imagine that like now you download your movies via tpb in the future you download your .3ds guns. i might not be an engineer for this matter but i certainly can look at several guns to learn. heck it may explode the first time but you know what, i can just print a new plastic one.

though 3d printers may sound very cool they are potentially also dangerous.

&gt; if i steal a bike and only ride it for five blocks then dump it its still stealing.

intellectual property is not the same as physical property.

a bike is tangible. if you take a bike, the owner is less a bike.

a song is intangible. if you make a copy, the owner still has their copy.

that's not to say that copying without permission is perfectly okay to do. however, it's by no means the exact same as theft.
technology music
==============================	

one could argue that the content owner is less the money they would have received had said person bought the song instead. contrarily however, they've only actually lost a **potential** sale, so it's just as arguable that said copier may well have never bought said song regardless whether copying was an option or not. additionally, this doesn't even account for instances where copying has lead to more sales by virtue of allowing potential purchasers to demo the full product before deciding whether it's worth the purchase or not.

copying is not the same as stealing. it's a murky grey area that has it's benefits and negatives, for **both** sides. right now you have content owners decrying copying, claiming lost revenue, yet being completely unable to provide provable tangible numbers of said supposed lost revenue. the issue is far more complex than simply one copy equaling one lost sale.

dog has a conviction for first degree murder from back in the 1970s.  [link here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duane_chapman#legal_issues).  the story is sketchy, but his version of it has him sitting outside in the car when the whole thing happened, like every other innocent felon in the world.

this is a valid concern but in detail-light articles like the op it's hard to say. the last time everyone was up in arms about 3d printing and guns, it was a guy printing one specific part of an ar-15 (the receiver, above)

apparently this guy was printing pistols? so what parts, exactly, was he printing? 
show me the barrel.
iirc, someone finished an all plastic rifle but the barrel only lasted a shot or two before melting
considering a 3d printer requires a computer to be useful, i'm going to have to call bullshit on that one.

and when 3d printers begin to make bombs... is your argument the same?
that or you do what people did when they lost their keys while out. call a locksmith or break in in other ways. your device to make rare-ish shitty situations any worse, but it does make everyday situations better.
nope, only if you build one that falls under the purview of the nfa (sbr, aow, sbs, mg, dd).  and even those (except mg) you just need to file for a tax stamp.  but if you avoid those no-nos, you don't need any paperwork.  
if you look at his link, you would see that your 'superior hardware' gets smoked in most benchmark tests. lol sucks to be an android fanboy who consistently has to watch their supposed newer hardware unable to keep up with the iphone. but i guess when you are a sucker for numbers that don't actually mean anything, i guess that is what you have to live with.
one of these days someone is going to publish an article that will accurately explain to people that bittorrent is a protocal to transfer data not much different from a medium like radio or televison. it is time to stop blaming the messanger for the message. 
a printer deposits ink and moves back and forth on an x and y axis to "build" an image or text.

a 3d printer does the same thing only it movies on an x, y and z axis. it can also use materials other than ink. the material gets stacked up and forms a 3d object.

here's the thing: neither tw nor att are offering the city the same deal, so why should they expect to get the same or similar deal?

what has basically happened here is that google allowed the city to negotiate a favorable deal on behalf of its residents.  in essence, by waiving or minimizing certain permitting requirements and installation costs, the city got its residents a connection-cost only deal.   so long as the per capita saving to each resident is greater than the costs waived or reduced, then the city did its job.

==============================	
i doubt very much that at&amp;t and tw have the same thing in mind.
if we assume a 1-dimensional line, with one end being total anonymity and the other end being a totalitarian police state, then every step *away* from anonymity is a step *towards* a police state.
in my mind and what i've seen come out of the 3d printer at my school, this gun would only be a model. it wouldn't have any functional parts. unless the guy was planning on modeling the parts and fitting them together after the fact. this just doesn't seem to me like it should be as big a deal.
i completely agree with you but shouldn't this apply to other areas as well? if it is obvious to us that the gov is made up of corrupt morons who shouldn't be making decisions about topics they know nothing about then shouldn't nearly everything be decentralized and be in control of the individual as opposed to top down forced solutions ? 
is the internet making at the minimum libertarian arguments and perhaps even anarchic arguments make more sense ?

the same can be said about printing guns.  good luck printing a proper rifled barrel.

oh wait, you're wrong in every substantial fashion. shame that.
in this article they are focusing a lot on comparing it to older iphones. also, the s3 was tested with ics, which is slower than jellybean, which in itself is optimized for multi-core processors. so in essence, not all of these benchmarks are correct. and i did read the controversy section as well.
your link has nothing to do with how megaupload was out of control with piracy. this isn't a debate about if we think pirating is ok or not.
if 3d printing takes off, and it will, this sets a very scary precedent. especially for more civilised countries where firearms are very illegal, homemade or not. 
viruses, yes. bugs, no. it was never once claimed that apple products are 100% bug-free.
metalstorm guns would be a nfa no-no, because "they can be readily adapted to full auto".  atf is against electronic firing mechanisms for the same reason.  

before you try to make sense of it:  it doesn't make sense.  
what laws are these and what do they apply to?
for those of you not getting the reference, john malkovich's character in the 1993 movie '[in the line of fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/)', staring clint eastwood, makes a composite pistol (basically plastic) for the purpose of getting it past metal detectors in a plot that involves the president. for this reason i could see why certain organizations would be concerned about people being able to do this at home.

the earth does cast a shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse (as seen from earth). i suppose that's a solar eclipse from the moon, with the earth doing the eclipsing. anyway, it goes as dark as night on earth when there is a solar eclipse, so as there is no atmosphere on the moon, i'd expect the area of shadow to be even darker than here.  

it would still be lit by starlight, but so is the lunar night-side usually.

i suspect it's possible to print a fully functioning weapon. it would be crude but you don't need much to fire off a single bullet.

of course, there are many unwholesome uses for a one time weapon which needs to go through a security check/metal detector, and where the bearer doesn't mind being caught or killed after firing it...
as someone who has worn and loved a casio databank wristwatch for the past 15 years, i like this article. however the title op picked is...sorry, pretty bad. better would have been the article's title... **"google patents smart watch with flip-up display"**

i think they'll be about as popular as tools like cordless drills, common, but not as common as 1+ per every household as the computer is today. 

i see the most common applications of the 3d printer to make parts and tools like screws, bolts, nuts, and wrenches. also custom applications for nearly everyone including fans and parts for building your own pc, to making parts for car interiors and exteriors. so i can really see this taking off.

personally i don't even own a personal paper printer, i go to local places that'll print what i need. i see this happening with 3d printers

i'm sorry, i don't read hunting magazines.
this is probably the most blatant violation of privacy that faces americans today. this is the government saying, "we know you want your cell phones, we know you need them. but, if you're going to carry one then you shouldn't expect us to not snoop on you." so, next if the government wants to turn on the microphone on your cell phone and listen to your private conversations, that becomes a pretty easily justified extension of their right to track your location. i don't know how to put it any clearer, the government wants you to be afraid of it. they want you to be afraid of doing anything that might even slightly threaten their standing as the supreme overseers of your life. they want you to know that they are tracking you, or at least that they might be. that makes you much more likely to be a good little sheep.

good point. my first, easy technical solution would be to run high surface area pipes under the soil to pipe water through. this would be similar to an atmospheric water cooling system, but would need to be much larger since the surface contact of the soil is going to be much less than air would be and be a pretty effective insulation. another way would be a massive infra-red generating cooling plate to bleed it off into space.

going higher tech, you could use thermoelectric generators, like peltier coolers or sterling engines to transform the heat into kinetic or electrical energy. possibly use this to power a communication laser, or feed the electricity back into the system. this is just making the chip more energy efficient though, so i'm pretty sure that you are going to gain enough entropy that eventually you are going to have to bleed off some heat through infra-red or into the soil though.

so short answer: big ass heat sink to compensate for lack of air.

nope. that's "distributing" as far as the atf regulations are concerned. as i understand it, you can make your own firearms, ammunition, even suppressors (with the right tax stamps) as long as they are for personal use.

i'm guessing they have a problem with it because a plastic gun could be used to kill someone with and then destroyed much easier than a metal one.

i can't be exactly sure why, but i'm guessing it could be due to a number of different reasons. 

i have heard that google ran into some issues where certain areas required that the fiber be buried instead of hung from poles, thus they have yet to to enter those areas. 

they could also just be concentrating on the areas that have a higher population density first and seeing the initial reaction before going to areas with smaller population density.
well this goes for anything. if someone wants in bad enough, they'll find a way. hell, they could just break a window and bypass the door entirely. this kind of tool isn't for additional security - its more for auditing and convenience of letting people (including yourself) in and out of your house.

you express a common sentiment, but it is fallacious to describe a democracy as a person.  democracies are groups of people acting by consensus.  laws, for instance like prohibiting assassination, make sense in a democracy.

so the far side would actually have more sunlight than the close side? 
extremely improbable.

the fact that you define these pure luck/chance discoveries as something that happens very quickly means that the probability that all pure luck-based discoveries have been discovered already is significantly high.

besides, fusion is one of those things that can't be really revolutionary and instantaneously changed because we already know of fusion and we also know that efficiency is very difficult to increase. sure, cold fusion could be discovered tomorrow, but it most likely(as in almost surely) wouldn't be efficient at all and would require a long, long time to improve to a usable level.

wtf is that an image of?
it's a legal grey area, there's definitely precedent to suggest that the government has a case (mostly the fault of conflicting past decisions). it is not blatantly unconstitutional.

in fact, the supreme court likely will have to overrule the "third-party doctrine" in order to protect fourth amendment rights in this case. that doctrine states that the action of submitting to a third party information which may be private in one context automatically disqualifies it from fourth amendment protection so long as the information is voluntarily submitted.

for many reasons it will be difficult to argue that the information is submitted involuntarily by the cell phone. it would delegate the impossible task for law enforcement to ensure that the owner of the cell phone is aware of what it is submitting to the phone company, or how it is acting -- rather than holding the operator accountable for his/her property's actions.

instead the entire doctrine will probably be thrown out (or "voluntary" might be changed to "voluntary and explicit"), so it might be important that they're arguing this case at all. jumping to conclusions like "treason!" makes you look like an idiot in this perspective.

are we in /r/worldpolitics again? there's kind of nothing we can do about it, the only people we can 'vote out' have all the purchasing power to be voted in, and a bipartisan system means we can only possibly communicate well enough to get the lesser of two evils.

i, personally, am leaving at the next chance, but it's pretty much a deadlock.
it may be more sinister than that. i just read [this article in the economist](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/09/3d-printing?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/difference_engine_the_pc_all_over_again_) yesterday about the coming fight against 3d printing. it mentions that the devices might face negative propaganda because of legitimate manufacturers fear of loss of intellectual property.

&gt;because of a 3d printer's ability to make perfect replicas, they will probably try to brand it a piracy machine.

statasys is a big company and one of the leaders in 3d printing. i'm sure their legal team got involved when they found out what their new lease holder was up to, but their reaction will do nothing but fan the flames of this completely fallacious argument. 
education point: in most states making your own firearm, for your own use (can't be sold), is not illegal, and does not even need to be registered (unless it's a special class like aow, select fire, suppressed, or short barreled rifle or shotgun).
this is less of a tech failure than a person failure.  if the people did a proper follow through this would have never escalated.

it's like when a upc reader fails to read a barcode because the person is swinging the object too far from the reader [or at a bad angle].  does that mean all barcodes are horrible?  or user error?

this is user error.

the ip5 has less display room (6.7in^2 to 9.8in^2); however, has a higher pixel density of 326 to 306. ip5 may have a more accurate display in terms of color considering there are 326 diodes for each color while 3s has 306 green and 216 red/blue.

the thin red line was originally 5 hours long. after the final cut, the performances of billy bob thornton, martin sheen, gary oldman, bill pullman, lukas haas, jason patric, viggo mortensen and mickey rourke were cut out.
edit: also, some of the actors ended up as cameos after the cut, like george clooney and john travolta.

practice the voice talking into an empty cup so that it gives it the artificial echo.  think about sean connery's accent.  this will train your ear to the voice.  then, assuming there is somewhat of a cavity in the mask you bought around the mouth, just adjust your pitch to make it sound like how you got it with the cup.

&gt;you deserve it for crying about downvotes in the edit.

this is the reddit equivalent of punching someone in the arm, and then punching them again for rubbing it. it's stupid and childish, and adds nothing to the conversation other than antagonism. sometimes it's important to point out that people are downvoting for stupid assed reasons. downvoting because you have some weird stick up your ass about people who don't "just take it" is one of those reasons.

i know more than a few black people who might beg to differ that these lyrics are the "way" they talk. besides, hardly even a majority of the lyrics i've seen in this thread are even from hip-hop, and most of *those* are of the party rap variety, which by and large is on lyrical life-support.

i am a canadian citizen living in canada and i waited 11 hours in a montreal hospital trying to get my wrist stitched up after having been stepped on with a hockey skate.  11 hours in a waiting room is ridiculous.  i ended up leaving and going to my university health clinic at 9 am and having them stitch me up (they were nice enough to let me skip the line).

point is, one person's story doesn't make it true for everyone.  the canadian system does have some major flaws and they must be addressed before people can call it a solution. 
well yes, many do live off of $10,000 a year. its doable with lots of ramen and no kids. but resort living it isn't.

especially when, in reality, you can do the same shit with 20 loosers with airlines tickets and four airplanes, for a hell of a lot less cash.

the spiraling costs of health-care are due to *unique* feature of the health-care market: namely, it does not follow the product life cycle that other markets do.

if you are diagnosed with cancer, and you are poor, would you be satisfied with the level and type of care that was available in the 1980's? of course not.

if you are poor, would you be willing to drive a car manufactured in the 1980's? of course you would.

in health-care only the most modern techniques are acceptable for *all* recipients - and the price is inelastic, because people are willing to pay whatever they can for good health.

so - the more unregulated (or "free" if you prefer) the market, the greater the pace of innovation; because production of goods and services in a unregulated market slant toward those who can most afford them, i.e. the wealthy.

a movie about a president being assassinated is not a death threat (though it may be in bad taste).  a person saying "the president is an anti-american pro-terrorist crypto-muslim and we need shoot him!" is.  if you can't see the difference between the two i suggest you need to give your line of thinking a bit more analysis.

&gt;ever hear of organic agriculture? crop rotation? those produce just as much food.

organic agriculture is expensive. how about you tell those immigrants making 10k a year that their loaf of bread is going up from $1 to $5.

these methods are at significant risk for catastrophic crop loss due to pests, or crop loss due to drought. remember the dust bowl in the 1920s? they also can take up significant pollutants from the soil, like pcbs or arsenic. 

they also require pesticides/herbicides and fertilizers that kill our watersheds.

first off, i never said the fda does rigorous testing i said every single gm food item has to go through rigorous scientific testing before getting fda approval. we're talking millions of dollars worth of testing here. second, i could post a link to any number of these tests, but when you post shit like 

&gt;the fda is a joke of a bureaucracy, and bends for whatever corporation gives them the most money.

it makes me wonder if i should even bother since you come off as a nutty conspiracy theorist who would deny any favorable result for gm food despite its test's funders or methodology.

also, i will gladly counter that tabloidishly written article with an article of my own.

and no, i do not work for industrial agriculture or supporting industries.

&gt;organic agriculture is cheaper than industrial

not really. while some costs are externalized the real savings are produced from the tremendously large scale, and a well entrenched distribution and processing network.

&gt;claiming that organics require pesticides and herbicides, but are also at risk for crop loss due to things pesticides and herbicides fight.

organics require topicals, gm crops require less because they have some resistance already. organics are at higher risk because the effect is transient.  

politics technology
==============================	
&gt;gm crops don't have demonstrably better drought resistance than heirloom crops bred for the same purpose. 
&gt;gm crops don't take up fewer pollutants from the soil.

genetic modification is a tool, not a product. simply because something does not exist today commercially, does not mean that it cannot be created. i cited examples that are on the horizon for gmos.

if you had glanced at the literature i posted you could see that genes have been implicated in drought resistance and it is only a matter of time before they are exploited, through breeding and/or transgenics. 
there are also many mutants that currently exist in labs that take up less toxins from the soil. 

&gt;highly recommend you read the omnivore's dilemma

politics technology
==============================	
read it, i agree that we, as a species need to develop a equilibrium with nature. i prefer sustainable and local agriculture to the organic craze because it better represents what we should be striving for, using both technology and the natural ecosystem to our advantage.

&gt;claiming risk is miniscule because it's never been studied is never a good plan.

the simple biology of it lends itself to low risk. they are taking known proteins that we have been eating for millenia and putting them in different species. the toxic impact of current gm crops has not been proven in any of the studies done. future gm crops will be made using similar methods, that is, made current proteins more hearty, or simply making a currently non-toxic protein transgenic. while it is certainly possible to create a toxic gm crop, it is to no ones advantage. 


funny you are writing a paper on transgenic crops, because i studied them too. a lot. rigorous testing by those corporations doesn't mean much to the average person, because we are well aware of how companies skew statistics and internal testings the way they see fit. that isn't a conspiracy theory, that is fact. since you are writing a paper right now, i will assume you are in college. you are young. and like all college students (us too back in the day), you believe you understand the world better than anyone. i am not a conspiracy theorist, and if you believe anyone who distrusts giant corporations is a conspiracy theorist, then you are going to isolate yourself pretty badly in this world. there has been no testing by "outside" sources, for example the fda to prove if gm crops are safe or unsafe. imagine that monsanto invested millions and millions of dollars into their seeds, and their tests reveal that they cause cancer, do you think they will stop selling their seeds? probably not. they would skew the results so the fda would approve them. 
now, i find your article to be quite interesting. but again, that is only a small sample of the world. my whole basis for this argument is that gm crops are untested and unknown. there is no way to know if they are healthy or unhealthy. if you like eatting unnatural foods that have been created in a lab, then good on you. but me, i don't.

i am aware of the controversy surrounding the deaths from l-tryptophan and at least from my perspective have viewed as an issue of contamination. i personally think that genetic engineering simply got scapegoated due to it being a relatively new technology at the time. in the scientific community it has largely been debunked as not the fault of the engineered bacteria.

l-tryptophan is not food, it is purified protein, a far cry from the mix of macromolecules that your daily meals are. it would be like comparing tabasco sauce to pepper spray.

people are not being forced to grow gm crops, they are choosing to because they are superior. furthermore, monsanto does not have anything close to a monopoly, they simply have a popular product in the agricultural field. there are many many other corporations, research institutes, etc. that practice genetic engineering for profit.

a very large percentage of crimes and generic bad judgement are things that a person was presented with or came across easily.  the same argument (if they want to do it they'll find away around) is used on other things, like regular door locks.   while those security methods do not decrease the percentage odds of success, they significantly decrease the number of attacks (which would have been 100% successful)  

a good example of this is your household door lock, which is 100% breakable but works as a solid deterrent against all kinds of casual thief.    another would be "suicide barriers" on bridges.

adding a single (beatable, but relatively obscure) layer of security will stop casual password thieves, which will prevent at least some people getting their password stolen, but won't stop people from recovering their password if they need it.

how is larry wall's cult any less hateful than scientology? just because the ancient myths and flat out lies they use to justify treating gays as less than human are more "christian" don't mean they're less hateful. they even went to the trouble of publishing a clarification that leaves no room for doubt, so larry wall has no room to claim that he believes in his cult's dogma, but doesn't hate gays, because that would be contradictory. he constantly brings up the subject of his religion in public, so the ball's in his court to denounce his cult's hateful beliefs, or else consent to it by his silence on that matter.

so now you're pulling ridiculous apologetics out of your ass for larry wall and his cult, which is even **worse** than silence: you're making up lame excuses why you think it might be ok for him tow the anti-gay agenda. not wanting to start a family tiff is no justification, when gay kids are committing suicide because of christian bullying. as long as we're wildly speculating: maybe he doesn't want to start a family tiff, because he wants to inherit his father's money. 

you're trying to justify a christian cult's hatred and larry wall's consent of hatred, therefore **you** are part of the problem too, because your stepping up to the plate and speaking out to defend and justify hatred is **much worse** than consenting to hatred by silence.

any physical security is mere obfuscation. this is good because it prevents someone getting to your machine and just running scans, like the intext search functions, to get your password. it's a happy medium between no "security" and a complex and expensive obfuscation that wastes dev time and would only take hackers a week/month to de-obfuscate, should they wish.

pretty much :)

what cracks me up is that i've applied for some jobs that were ideal for me, that i felt at the end of the day i did not get for this very reason in combination with bullshitters.

i have a friend who states he has "deep technical skills" that actually has very little in the way of technical skills.  great bullshitter and absolute liar though, so no problem getting a job for him.

sometimes i think my candid nature works against me too much and that i'd be better off just lying the next time i need to find a job.  it just irritates me to think that i'd need to do something like that.

thankfully i like the current job i have so its not a problem i'll have to deal with any time soon :)

thinking or calling someone else a sinner is a sin in christianity. remove the log from your own eye before pointing out the splinter in your brothers and all that. also, judgement is left up to god. 

nb, i am a atheist, but the above beliefs are a core tenet that most christians get wrong. the early church fathers wrote extensively about this, because arguing over who is more saved than who, or who is more of a sinner than someone else, was felt to lead to pride ( i'm obviously more saved than he is! ) which was felt to be a deadly sin, or tear churches apart in recrimination. or they worried that feeling you were saved would lead to a backsliding on the path to salvation, a false sense of safety, and a lack of spiritual progress.

so by even uttering it from his lips, larry is showing a big flaw. besides, there might be a alcoholic out there, who while in one way is more of a sinner than larry, may also carry out good works that shadow anything he has ever done. 

basically "don't judge a book by its cover", "judge not, lest ye be judged (god will judge you on how you treat others)", "remove the log from your own eye before complaining about the speck in your brothers (we're all broken in different  ways )"
programming politics
==============================	

protestant groups tend to be a lot more into "we're saved we are better than you". catholics/ orthodox tend to be "we're all broken in different ways", and this shows up even in stories about the saints, who were never perfect people. 
the teachings vary by church too, which makes it even more confusing. most christians then don't even believe in the specific tents of their church!

#1, google is an advertising *platform*. they don't create ads. they're just the platform that delivers the ad content. when's the last time clear channel communciations (billboards) gave away freebies to highlight their service?

*advertisters* give away freebies. that's why you can get lots of pepsi swag or activision swag when you go to conventions - they're the ones who have a product to sell, and they give out relatively inexpensive freebies as an advertisement (if someone buys a $50 blizzard game, that easily pays for the $5 it cost to print a tshirt).

&gt; ask microsoft about their windows phone. end-users are more important than developers. ask apple about their iphone 1.0.

&gt; users attract developers, developers do not attract users, ask google about gears and wave.

wrong on two counts. 1. with this example, do you think it makes sense to say, "if google releases 1000 free phones to regular users in the wild, this will really expand the android userbase and thus attract developers"

developers attract users. that's why palm/hp's webos is a *complete* non-entity these days. it's a highly competitive platform, and a lot of people love and swear by it over ios and android. but there are no developers for it, thus no apps for it, thus no users for it.

    vehicles.add(new car);

if truck,car, and bus inherit from the interface ivehicle they all are required (or compiler will not compile) to have publicly accessible methods and variables defined in the interface. it also lets you do multiple inheriting in c# (not sure about java) i could make a class called schoolbus that inherits from bus but also from the interface itransporter.
reading [wikipedia paints a different, (likely biased) picture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_genome_sequencing#race_to_commercialization). i assume the narrative is a mess because of competing financial interests fighting over the content. obviously many people are projecting / planning for cheap sequencing, because it's in their best interest to be optimistic, but even the picture advertised prices paints shows the price going from 40k to 30k to 20k to 10k. 

even a linear picture suggests we're closer than 48 years. your data points do as well; it suggests doubling every two years or faster. price halved from 2006-&gt;2008, and price nearly halved and snps doubled in 2008-&gt;2010. 

it's possible the technology 23&amp;me is pursuing fits their objectives of selling analysis, rather than working towards full genome sequencing. how would they test for snps they don't know exist, and what would they say? i assume they plan to take it up when it's more profitable than their existing system and no sooner, and other companies will eventually carry the torch to their doorstep. the greater challenge by far is medical research keeping up with the pace of data.

hey, thats what math is.

what you mean is "doing calculations"
programming sports
==============================	
&gt; actually the reason for introducing radians is as follows. the length of the circumference of a unit circle (a circle of radius 1) is exactly 2 * pi. that means that the length of the circumference is exactly equal to the number of radians in a full circle. do we gain any advantage by this knowledge? no, but mathematicians think it is cool.

seriously?  okay, here's what we gain from knowing this.  if your circle's radius is 1, the length of the arc described by an angle and the angle's size in radians *are exactly the same thing*.  this is useful if you need to convert radius and change in angle per unit time into velocity, to pick just one of the many things a game programmer might use this information for.

**edit**

of course, if you measure angles using an eight-bit system and discard anything over 255, you're going to run into some interesting other problems if you try to calculate velocity from an angle.
neither of those. calculations can be automated.

math is human made abstractions, symbols simply try to describe those abstractions.

yes. i don't think schools more advanced than that really use silly mnemonics like "soh cah toa". [wikipedia at least indicates that trig is usually taught in middle schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trig).

the marginal cost of storage for these articles is miniscule. right now i can buy hdds with a per/gb cost of ~$0.10. we're talking about a few hundred kilobytes in the worst possible case -- $0.0001 per entry.
i was talking about the runtime overhead of pthread_cancel.

sure, if you only care about static linking, most of the functions in those categories above won't matter.  but who cares about static linking in 2011?  those functions do matter in the dynamic linking case...
i suppose my opinion could be elaborated or expanded. i think gnu hurd has it's place in an encyclopedia because it is a part of the history of the gnu project, and explains the effort that was undertaken to have a gnu kernel.

i really don't think nemerle meets wikipedia's notability guidelines.

if you want to claim that those guidelines should be overturned, that's all and good, but that's a seperate debate that should take place outside of the afd page.
those deletionists really start to piss me off. people invest work to create an article about some topic and those fuckers delete it because they think it's not "notable" enough for their glorious egos. 

wikipedias amount of articles isn't limited by space. while it's necessary for paper-based encyclopedias to limit the number or articles, this simply isn't the case for a web-site. 

if people fear that there is "information overload", the solution is simple: tag articles, remove references or put them in a "less noticable" category. but idiots like this stupid monsanto fuck aren't simply able to grasp the difference between a paper based medium and a computer based one. and because of their stupidity they kill the work of lots of people. and for what? for nothing besides their fucking egos.

maybe it's time to start a fork to bring wikipedia in the 21st century...

projection from 3d onto the screen can also be done with matrix multiplications. at that point you realise it really does make sense to do as much as you can in vectors + matrices. 

i don't really have any good online resources for this stuff to hand (i'm sure some exists) but i am pretty sure vector calculus is _not_ the correct term for it (that's differentiation and such). many of the resources tend to get into the mathematical side rather than what is useful for geometry/graphics.

also, the reason to stick to radians in math isn't what the author says. rather, it's because it's the only unit of angle measurement in which the derivative of the sin function is the cos function. this is the real usefulness of rad, and calculus and anything built upon it becomes instantly incredibly harder if you don't use radians.

my pokemon website's being developed by 100 people but it doesn't have a wikipedia page. it's not about how much effort people put in it or how much important the project is, it's all about notability. have you got some reliable sources about hurd? it's all written in wikipedia's rules, if it's not *notable* it can't be there.
i, for one, welcome our new robot police overlords.
programming politics
==============================	

my point was that implying that wikipedia is something lesser than a real encyclopedia because of controversy over articles that a real encyclopedia wouldn't even consider including is ridiculous.

wikipedia is something greater than an ordinary encyclopedia in large part because they *can* include articles like this and they do everyone a disservice by refusing to do so.  as someone else pointed out here, anything of greater relevance than a personal page should be kept.  it costs nothing and the idea of "clutter" on wikipedia is silly.  no one is thumbing through pages here.  people get to articles by searching and clicking on related links.  even if an article were irrelevant to most people, it's unlikely that the uninterested majority would ever even see it.
the worse sea of shit examples i've had to swim through for a project was with sql. i think i've permanently lost a few brain cells as a result.
well, i won't judge what's important to other people; i'm sure there's a sociologist *somewhere* cursing every wikipedia deletion of a pokemon article because he/she was working on a thesis about video game obsession or the like. i *still* don't see why deleting things outside your purview really matter; i mean, let's delete the prescheme article, because it doesn't add anything you can't find in the linked articles, and it's a niche subject at best.

the fact that this issue comes up so often indicates that the "notability" standard is broken.

of course fixing it would require some sort of arcane bureaucratic song and dance which really can't be initiated by an "outsider".

this is a common phenomenon. people within a bureaucracy tend to protect the structure and resist change at all cost. the only way to fix it is to knock it down and start over (fork), which resets the cycle.

it's funny because i &amp; others are using pokemon as an example of seemingly trivial things that are on wikipedia, but when i looked through his userpage, it referenced his pokemon site. that's why it's funny, at least to me.
i fully believe the compromises demanded by the realities of staffing and printing are the only reasons brittanica doesn't contain an entry on nemerle. neither of these constraints apply to wikipedia, so i'm going to stand by the original statement.

if you'd like i could amend it to "i start to think it's an insult to *to the principles of* encyclopedias...". just to make the patently obvious fully clear.

i find [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:errors_in_the_encyclop%c3%a6dia_britannica_that_have_been_corrected_in_wikipedia) to be a hilariously meta take on the subject. and [here](http://news.cnet.com/study-wikipedia-as-accurate-as-britannica/2100-1038_3-5997332.html) is some confirmation.
i guess we're in violent agreement? maybe not. either way, it seems our opinions here are generally the same.
the basic notion of wikipedia is flawed.  "it's an encyclopedia, but it's electronic!"  whoop-dee-freakin'-doo.

the users have thrust onto wikipedia their vision of an actual useful thing--an organized repository of the rapidly exploding amount of information in the human world.

but that's **not** what wikipedia is intended to be.  it's meant to be an encyclopedia, of the 18th-century variety.  nothing more than a self-contained, abridged non-fiction library.  if the information isn't somewhere else, preferably in some weighty tomb on the shelves of national libraries, it is not worthy of inclusion in the encyclopedia wikitanica.
programming politics
==============================	

&gt; there are people who care about that stuff and tomorrow i could be one of them. and if not, why would i search for it? it doesn't hurt one bit to have that extra stuff there.

so long as it has *something* of note, i don't see the issue. i agree that personal projects shouldn't be on wikipedia until they have *some* level of adoption that makes them interesting; just like we don't necessarily need a wikipedia entry for every minor star wars character, we probably don't need an article per cms system. still, i think there should be more of an "expert run" atmosphere (although that has many problems too!); wtf do i know about ibises, turtles, languages spoken by 10 or fewer people or anything else outside my purview? 

&gt; he probably got one of his pokemon articles deleted and now he wants revenge.

he could just be a puritanical wikipedean (however it is spelt); there are fanatics &amp; zealots in every group. still, being irked over a personal project being deleted is a possible root cause.
no, you're missing my point.

programming politics
==============================	

you only need to do that once though (or use a library that does it), and after that matrices can handle most things.

it's always good to understand the underlying trig though. for one thing, like the article said, it's very natural to store at the least part of the base rotation using angles. a common form for things like player characters is using hpr (heading, pitch, and roll) angles to store rotation.

there are other useful techniques. quaternions are indispensable for blending or averaging two or more rotations together. there's really no way to cleanly average two rotation matrices and get a valid resulting rotation matrices, but quaternions handle the task perfectly. both quaternions and euler angles (a generalized form of the more specific hpr angles) are also much more efficient for transmitting rotations over a network, evan after including position.

quick graphs: [dividing by 2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=maximum%28%7cx%7c%2c%7cy%7c%29+%2b+minimum%28%7cx%7c%2c+%7cy%7c%29+%2f+2+%3d+1) vs [dividing by 4](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=maximum\(|x|,|y|\)+%2b+minimum\(|x|,+|y|\)+/+4+=+1). i'd probably go with 1/2 as you say.
this. people don't like the result of this debate, but they sit back and pout rather than proposing an alternative notability standard.

"i'd love to fork wikipedia &amp; take a more inclusive approach."

how would that work?

i want specifics. for example, would i be allowed to add false information? would i be allowed to delete other people's false information? would i be allowed to add pages about non-existent subjects that i've invented and present them as if they are real?

i just want a basic schematic of your fork.
of course factor is notable! i'm pretty sure most programmers have at least heard of factor.
but pokemon is a massively successful media franchise that includes many best-selling games. the user in question isn't deleting articles because he thinks they're "trivial", but because he thinks they're "non-notable". even if you think pokemon is "trivial", it's hard to deny that it's a notable subject.
are you trying to imply that the people *running* wikipedia somehow are not responsible for information being deleted according to *their own* policies?

it is, which is why i just went through (with my account which has a longer edit history than his, lest anyone suspect me of being some random n00b who showed up to make trouble) all his afds and voted to keep, because this sort of random deletion spree isn't constructive and never really accomplishes anything. better to give these articles some attention and see how/whether they can be improved than to just spam "delete, nn" over and over.
heh. experts... they often get mobbed away by people who don't know anything about the topic. my brother observed such a case where *the* expert of a particular voting system (the inventor himself) got so annoyed by some wikipedia contributor (who didn't even understood the math behind it) that he just left. he just couldn't be arsed to fix the damage over and over again.

being an expert doesn't mean anything. same goes for being right. the one who's more stubborn always wins.

my most recent ridiculous query was a query that aggregated data from a dynamic number of databases in a ms sql cluster. the table names were the same in all of the dbs, so that wasn't an issue. the databases to pull from were determined by a maintenance table in one of the admin dbs.

no, debates are decided on a case by case basis, and the modal outcome is documented as 'policy'. there are no fixed rules. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:ignore_all_rules

wikipedia is most certainly not a republic. 2000 year old political systems have no place in a modern collaborative encyclopedia.

that said, the modal discussion about notability does typically end up  requiring dead trees these days. this is something that may need to be corrected at some point.
instead of /whining/ about the decisions other people make about what is placed on the website they run,  why not run your own and see how successful you are?  wikipedia is kind enough to use licensing liberal enough to get you started fast.  they'll even give you copies of articles which were previously deleted for notability reasons, though you have to ask.

i suspect a lot of the issues with managing it people, technical people, scientific people, or any sort of educated, intelligent people is that they are generally straight shooters. i say this is true especially in it.

i am a software developer and i have always been a straight shooter. i don't play office politics. i don't care about internal power struggles in the company. i just want to design and develop software to be proud of with minimum interference. collaborating with peers is one thing, but having technology-illiterate management (aka phbs) get in the way infuriates me and i usually tell them why they are complete idiots. i always back up my decisions the best i can to prove it isn't simply an ego thing.

i can do the occasional dog-and-pony show and put on a good face when dealing with clients, but i have no patience for meddling micro-managers. the best manager is the one who hires the most competent people they can find and stay out of the way and run interference from outside forces.

&gt; the question is how you decide who has "a more refined domain knowledge".

well, you get subject matter experts, peer review, and votes &amp; and a hole bunch of problems. it's a messy issue, and certainly non-trivial. i've worked in physics publishing on the peer review side; that stuff get's nasty, and i'm not even taking into account my *own* experiences with getting work published. i *do* think that if you're not contributing to the article, you're not contributing to the domain that the article is in, it shouldn't really be terribly important that it be deleted (other than in the case of spam, violation of law, or other category). yes this means you'll get all sorts of absolutely low-brow trivial garbage; it also means you'll have a higher propensity for gathering &amp; fostering domain experts.

==============================	
wikipedia should implement a policy that does not allow for moderators to motion for deletion. furthermore, more than two moderators should have to weigh in to delete an article with a majority "keep" vote. at least, that way, majority opinion would matter _somewhat_.

what do you think of these ideas? perhaps a general discussion of wikipedia policy might help, too.
