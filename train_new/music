well, there's *that* chord at the beginning of hard day's night.. try doing that one by ear!


and it's always nice to have a printed reminder in front of you; few things are less fun than getting started and then going "anybody remember where it goes from here?"

congratulations, you're an elitist douche.  
half the stuff they put up on tab sites comes with the heading:  "this is my first tab, not sure if its right but it sounds awesome on an acoustic when you're wearing tevas."

some dude asked for this... i think this is the closest to a guitar tab equivalent. still has some bugs but i'm sure those can be ironed out.
drums are _so_ much easier to figure out than guitar.

i can't say i've ever run into an occurrence where i needed drum tabs. plenty of times where i've been unable to grok something without bass/guitar tabs.

die you.
what's the average quality on these albums? (v0/v2/cbr 320/etc)


sorry, i meant

&gt;the *only* good music
peter gabriel played flute in a number of early genesis albums, particularly on the "selling england by the pound" album.

also, take a listen to the dutch band focus --- thiis van leer (keyboards, yodeling and flute) was phenominal at all of them.
you're right about that. it is a pretty half-assed attempt to improve anybody else's lot than the blogger. personally i'm starting to think of good mp3 blogs as playing a similar role that college radio used to - affirming what the best music coming out now is, and turning listeners on to some other similar new music.

a good example of mp3 blogging done right:

- [lend me your ears](http://earslend.blogspot.com/)

yes, i like really obscure music, so no, you want find any up-and-coming acts on there. but i think their ethic is pretty clear and respectful.

i really saw this comment going somewhere else with the hands... : (
that's because they all just write html scrapers and steal the tabs from each other for google ad revenue
don't take this as an insult, but that post only made you look like a wussy little crybaby. ;)
hey man better than i could do sadly.
congrats! you win the smartass award of the day, say i. let's see you write a better political song. that stuff doesn't exactly lend itself to poetry.
also, the man is not known for being a brilliant lyricist, so i have to also nominate you for self-evident comment award of the day.
it's not such a bad song. he states the issue concisely, without being too glib or too abstract. it sounds like a lot of his stuff from the early 70s, which sold really well, for some reason.

and as for the charge of 'meddling', seems like someone of irish decent born in england might have some personal stake in this topic.
all accounts i heard (and read online later) said he appeared 'out of it'.  whether it was intoxication or worn out, i can't say for sure, but i would say he put too much on his plate and showed a great deal of disrespect to everyone at the festival, fans and performers alike.

also, someone working the stage at bonnaroo said that pearl jam cleared the stage in plenty of time for kanye to set up, but that kanye's crew did not start work until their head dude arrived back from atlanta.

ultimate-guitar is good but when searching through an artists songs it's a pain in the ass to try and guess which page number it will be on.
http://www.last.fm/music/+tag/flute
yeah, it just sucks if you actually want an accurate tab, because they basically don't exist. 
they were until they started with all those fucking ads with sound.  and they don't even kick in when you load, sometimes i've had a tab up for 20 minutes and then an ad starts while i'm trying to record something.  frustrates me to no end but they have the best collection of tabs.
wow, i didn't know hosting tabs was actually illegal... any background, or did the riaa or someone just decide it should be?

the only thing that would make me happy is that all of his crappy songs would be destroyed!!!

a lot of us can easily identify chords and only resort to looking at tabs for particularly tricky or complex passages. unfortunately, 99.9% of tabs are useless for this purpose, by being wrong, incomplete, or just plain fucktarded, hence the need for a tabwiki.org.

however, the guitarist:song ratio will still be the same, so i'm not sure if there would be a vast improvement from the database/ratings system that is currently often used. anyone can post lyrics, but only guitarists can post tabs. whereas posting good lyrics is simply a matter of effort, posting good tabs requires more know-how, further deteriorating the available pool of tabbers. i'm not sure if this problem will go away because a wiki site is created.
well on ultimate-guitar you can vote on different versions, so that's at least something. i would prefer a nice standardized wiki-style notation though.
as a further boost to her metal cred, she has performed with the metal band earthen grave and survived a horrific accident where it seems she was given the choice between a 400 year old instrument or being dragged by a train.

[metra train accident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rachel_barton_pine#metra_accident)
i think as a whole the music communtiy is better for having shitty tabs online. if the tabs are bad then you actually figure it out yourself, and have to think about what the artist did, or at the very least use your ears. 


i developed a way stronger ear for guitar licks because tabs online are so blatantly wrong.
i recommend classtab.org if you are in to that sort of thing.
actually, he makes less money from regular cd sales, and offsets that with concert sales and memorabilia. (assuming that he's good though.)

i fucking hate tab!!!!! learn to play your goddamn instrument!!!! i have to be at fivehundred covers for the gig i'm trying to land and i'm having to sound out 90% of them off of youtube because you mother fuckers are too goddamn lazy to standardize your methods!!!! piano players have to read two clefs, sometimes three, compose on every clef (including the crazy c clefs for the viola and archaic pieces), read jazz/pop symbols, nashville number charts, and you motherfucking pussies are too goddamn lazy to use anything that any other instrument can pick up?!?!?! piano is the hardest goddamn instrument on the planet because of what's expected of us, and then i come here to see your ignorant whiny ass bitching in all caps!!!! if i have to type one more thing to you, i'm translating it between four different languages and leaving it here in simplified chinese so you can understand what it's like for a piano player when you motherfuckers figure something out (even though it's usually wrong), and leave it in tab only!!!!

hadn't heard this awhile, and never seen this video... forgot how powerful the song is, and the video really drove it home.

the two combined brought me to tears.

amazing how a simple fan-made vid with a truly great song can affect one so much.

edit: [live version](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xoka6_sade-pearls-live_events)
i don't know who this is. i don't care. i don't use itunes. i don't know what's current in pop music/culture. seeing this reminds me of why i'd like to keep it that way.

this artist is irrelevant, please keep him off and other similar non-talented and banal drivel off our reddits.

ps - if you want guaranteed karma, submit a unique story involving sigur ros and/or daft punk. that seems to work like flies on honey around here. :p
maybe the pirate bay guys will host it?
awesome. this looks very cool. spreading the word!
well if you don't already have transmissions from the satellite heart, get it - it is their best album.
there isn't really anything else like the flaming lips, which is what makes them so good.  but generally i think if you like the flaming lips you'll probably like the decemberists (her majesty), ween (the molusk), pixies (doolittle), neutral milk hotel (in the aeroplane over the sea) and anything by the talking heads.

+ pick song you want to play

+ listen to it

+ try to play it

+ possibly try to play along with it while it's on repeat

do the above steps over and over until you get better.
check out ratatat. it's just instrumental but it's awesome.
i'd say tv on the radio is close to flaming lips. maybe they are a bit heavier. 'dear science' (their newest one) is pretty good. i'd say go for that. 'return to cookie mountain' is very good too, but i'd say less accessible than 'dear science' so get into 'dear science first then move on to their others.
here's a great site if you want classical guitar sheet music.

http://www.eythorsson.com/en/default.aspx

it's very hard to find sheet music for other styles - which is a shame.
i'd suggest anything by [mercury rev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercury_rev)... dave fridmann, bassist for the band, has produced a lot of flaming lips records, and their latest ([snowflake midnight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snowflake_midnight)) is something pretty fantastic.

you may have also heard of a couple of their other records, especially [deserter's songs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deserter%27s_songs) and [all is dream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all_is_dream)
dear op,

this used to exist. it was called olga and it was sweet. chances are if you've ever downloaded a tab from the internet, it was originally posted in olga.

the site barely survived a lawsuit with emi, then died after receiving a takedown notice from the music publisher's asociation.

[olga on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olga)
i'm guessing you've listened to their other albums? the soft bulletin is a better album than yoshimi in my opinion. 

other than that i don't have  a lot of suggestions...maybe the animal collective.
broken social scene- you forgot it in people
drums are easy to figure out for the most part.  but often times there's little fills or ghost notes that become tricky to pick up. especially if you're trying to figure out the way they play it. 

also, duh its easier for you with a degree in percussion.  
there's a great documentary on the flaming lips called fearless freaks.
i know, i really fucked it hard.

-even this was terrible, i fail at wit.
the first instance i remember was emi fighting with [olga](http://olga.net/). i believe at one point, emi got them shut down, but they came back at some point. in this case it's not the riaa sending the takedown orders, but i believe they're breaking ground, making it easier for other organisations to abuse copyright laws.
how droll, you are obviously an expert on all things poetic. you also get the disgusting asshattery award. way to go!

the fact that men who were geniuses with words could compose poetry about such things is not proof that it lends itself to such a treatment. i *know* you are not implying that mccartney is a genius.... ?

....not that i need to say anything. you already made yourself look like enough of a jackass with that comment about your dick. let me just say keep dreaming, pal.
i'd say it's because he composed classical music better than anybody else. most musicians will name bach as the all-time greatest (and/or best) composer, but by haydn and mozart's time, music had moved on from the baroque era and into the classical, and mozart just did it better than anyone. not that there was a whole lot of competition (mozart and haydn are the only composers of that era who are generally considered among the all-time greats).
i can't tell if you're saying i don't believe in freedom. it's a topic i consider when i vote, and i've even written to my mp at times when i saw laws coming down the pipe that i felt reduced my freedoms. 

i agree in a way with the first statement though, but modified. free speech laws are obsolete. there's not too much need to protect free speech (at least online), since it's impossible to restrict it, given the way the internet works, and the research going into guaranteeing anonymity. there are actually groups working on getting the internet uncensored to china, so the technology is there already to provide free speech no matter what. 

in terms of tabs, don't worry about it. lawmakers will have to deal with reality at some point or another. for now we have ultimate-guitar.com. book publishers are becoming obsolete, and there's nothing any lawmaker on this side of the world can do about it. it will have to turn around at some point.

agreed on all counts.
get mgmt's album, it's similar in aesthetic but much poppier.
that is actually not a bad idea...it might seem wasteful at first to use torrents to distribute small text files, but it could be neatly organized in a firefox extension or something. it would solve the problem of hosting the tabs centrally.

[at war with the mystics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/at_war_with_the_mystics) and everything from  [the polyphonic spree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_polyphonic_spree)
this is the only suggestion i agree with.

this poppy space rock album with a brain will get you closer to the feeling of warmth you felt with yoshimi
agree with your agree, mostly because of the mollusk by ween. i'd also recommend the albums rings around the world and phantom power by super furry animals. 
hellllll yeah.
yeah, i dunno why i said that.  i was in a bad mood, i guess.

well deserved downmods to me are in order!
steve reich's different trains

also,  the flaming lips zaireeka album was an experience. 
then you'd prefer a *chord sheet*, not *tablature*. geesh, people.
check the **[music-map](http://www.music-map.com/flaming+lips.html).**
as the username shows this is right in my territory of knowledge.

radiator and guerilla are much more flaming lips like than r.a.t.w. and phantom power.  i'd highly recommend love kraft and the newest album dark days/light years.

although to be honest the best stuff can be found on their b-sides (ice hockey hair, roman road, tradewinds).  
[giveaway of the day - extra youtube downloader + converter](http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/extra-youtube-downloader-converter/ "giveaway of the day - extra youtube downloader + converter")
zaireeka's cool. i like the concept a lot, even if in practice it's a pain in the ass...

4 cds, all with different versions of the same tracklist, meant to be played at different volumes, different stereos affecting sound quality, you can play any combo of the 4 cds limitedo nly by how many cd players you have... you can offset them....

it's a lot of fun
soft bulletin is probably their masterpiece.  other albums just as good?  i can't recommend "yankee hotel foxtrot" by the band wilco enough.   in my opinion it's one of the best albums made in the last 20 years.  you may also want to try anything by the butthole surfers.  the flaming lips were pretty open about biting their style for live shows.  here are a few others you may enjoy:

architecture in helsinki : incase we die,
my morning jacket : evil urges,
clap your hands say yeah: self titled,
wolf parade : apologies to the queen mary  
the earlies - *these were the earlies*
this is almost exactly what i cam here to say. and yes i would agree, animal collective's latest album is recorded in a flourished manner similar to the delightful bravado of the soft bulletin or the inferior (in my opinion) yoshimi.

their earlier more rock-oriented stuff is also fantasic though not recorded the same vein as the very elaborate and electronic instrumentation of the soft bulletin. my two favorites by them are transmissions from the satellite heart and the soft bulletin, but it's hard to compare the two directly for me personally. the production of yoshimi is great ear-candy, but it wears thing quickly because the quality of the song writing is of such lower and almost dishonest sort. ' definitely their worst album even if it is a fun record and still better than a lot of what's out there. in other words, i don't want to call yoshimi straight-up bad, but you could hear much that's better.

if you're only really discovering psychedelic production for the first time and that's what's exciting you the most, then there's no end of music that could be recommended. i also recommend that you try listening to non-lossy cd quality music or even vinyl if you get a kick out of that kind of production; you'll be blown away if you've been used to listening to even high-quality mp3s.

i haven't seen a bad recommendation on this thread; all are for excellent music. but yeah, start with other stuff by the lips, yoshimi is nowhere near their best. spend a little time with their other recordings even if they're not what you were expecting at first. i'm sure you'll enjoy them.
*miner at the dial-a-view* is one of most beautiful songs i've ever heard.
fair enough. i love all those albums (and b-sides) you just mentioned. where i disagree with you is that 'yoshimi'/'rings' are probably both bands most ambitious projects which is why i find them more similar to each other. 
definitely - the new jason lytle album ("yours truly, the commuter") reminds me of ybtpr... similar 'ethereal' feel and vocal sound. it's a really good album too.
thanks for that - did not know you could do that
how about that space movie?
i'll be seeing them in memphis next week. very excited.
try *starlight mints*. 

also from wayne's secret stash of influences, track down a copy of michael nesmith's *from the radio engine to the photon wing*.  yes michael nesmith as a member of the monkees.  he's also a stellar musician and songwriter who won the first music video oscar, and had a top ten hit at the age of 20.
i'd like to elaborate more upon exploring other music formats, because our current music business environment seems to revolve around digital media, ignoring, if not discouraging, tangible formats such as cds ([44.1 khz and 16 bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compact_disc#audio_cd) is the standard, but other formats climb as high as 96 khz and 24 bit) or vinyl. 

vinyl sounds incredible because it's essentially the exact end user/listener manifestation of what the album production teams decision making process (writing and performance by the band; tracking: microphone selections and placement, pre-amp selection, tape/digital format selection, room type and shape; mixing: engineer, compression, eqs, reverb, what board one uses; mastering; the list could go on forever, really). 

digital media have poor high frequency reproduction because of the nature of the format. it just can't be done. the human ear can 'understand' frequencies between 20 hz and 20,000 hz (or 20 khz). within the 44.1 khz cd format, the highest frequency that can be produced is 22.05 khz. *but* it's a [traingle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangle_wave) wave. no qualities such as 'warm' or 'sharp' or 'bright' will be part of it.  you loose this quality in cds, making vinyl that much more extraordinary.
elloelloello.

not a huge fan of love kraft, but the new one (dd/ly) is growing one me. not sure if these two albums compare to the lips, though.

radiator is the best lp of the 90s though, just amazing.
i've only had the great experience to discover this recently. i've been moving my whole collection into cd quality flac. then then just last week i obtained flac copies of full resolution needle drops of from a renowned audio lab of some of the beatles records.

i know these recordings intimately but previously only from cd. listening to the vinyl flac was like hearing these songs for the first time. i keep having friends over, none of whom are audiophiles or dicks about music quality or anything like that and all of them were left in shock. we all just had no idea. it was like we had been lied to for years. 

vinyl has impefections in it like hiss and possibly pops. it's heavy and takes a lot of work to keep in solid condition. however, the breadth and depth of sound and imaging and placement of instruments is unreal compared to cds. 

it's important to note though, that it's not the nature of digital storage that makes cds not as full, it's just that they were developed with too low of a sampling rate. superaudio cds and some dvd audio have a high enough resolution to capture the full breadth of the analog of vinyl, but with the nose-free and light-weight advantages of digital.
the beta band. start with the best of album and go from there.
i absolutely love yoshimi as an album. true, some of the songs i feel in the mood to skip sometimes, but other times i enjoy those songs and skip others. i really like the sound textures.

what i really like, which i totally disagree with you, is the lyrics. i see yoshimi as a kind of atheist fable that helped me put my own beliefs into perspective. i was listening to the album when i was driving across the country to visit my mother in the hospital before brain surgery, and parts of the album really resonated with what i was feeling at the time. two lines in particular got me:

"instead of saying all of your goodbyes..."

and

"all we've ever had is now"
http://hypem.com/track/167014/dj+bc+-+yoshimi+battles+snoop+dogg+snoop+dogg+vs+the+flaming+lips
fair enough, i just find the lyrics a little lacking for my personal tastes, but i do agree that the message they try to convey is a beautiful one and it's great that it's touched you with such a personal connection.

' just a difference in personal tastes and if it wouldn't appear dishonest, i would probably change some of my wording in there. there's not doubt they're a wonderful band, and i too often write about music with words that sound objectively-authorotative, when really, whether or not you like an album or why is a very personal and subject experience. :)

it was perhaps innapropriate of me to speak so poorly of yoshimi when what this is supposed to be about is what might be similar that someone would also like. given that, my reccomendation would still be the rest of the flaming lips' catalog before trying to compare them to other bands.


100% correct.very good post.
&gt;so are vinyl flacs better than cd flacs?

flac isn't limited to just cd level quality. it can go higher. it's a larger file, but you can take an uncompressed 192khz/24-bit recording from an analog input of vinyl record playing and then make a flac file out of it that loses nothing. it's much larger than a cd quality flac file, but it retains all of the breadth of vinyl. 

you need a killer sound card to pull this off, but the results are amazing.
that's what i was trying to address with the standard cds. i'm aware (and actually *love*) superaudio cds and audio dvds. they sound amazing, but despite their clarity and mechanical reproduction, there is a quality that vinyl still possesses solely. it's the warmth. the highest sampling and bit rates known to man can't replicate the endearing quality of tape hiss and vinyl pops. also, over time, vinyl gets warmer, because the needle smooths out the ridges as locks smooth out key ridges after years of usage. of course, in excess this can be detrimental to your vinyls (which is why proper needle counterweight balance is crucial), but a tinge of wear-n-tear sounds amazing.
wonderful. good to know. my experience this past week has been so jaring, that i've already purchased a turn table. just yesterday i posted on the linux and wearethemusicmaker subreddits looking for help finding a 64-bit linux compatible sound card that does 192kbs/24-bit analog input so i can start archiving "needle drops" on the computer. i feel a fool for having never taken vinyl advocates seriously enough in the past or taking the time to do the listening/research for myself. well, better late than never!
i recently heard a mono sgt. pepper on vinyl and realised i was hearing it properly for the first time ever.the difference in sound quality between vinyl and all other formats is astonishing.unfortunately we live in a world where convenience trumps quality. 
flaming lips at war with mystics.
spread the word!
kleptones remixed it as yoshimi battles the hip hop robots.  pretty cool and free from their website
i like the song heartless by kanye west. i usually listen to goth/industrial music, but i just like that song.
absolutely.  the untrained ear could mistake the song "holes" as being a flaming lips track.  totally recommend them.
you have no idea (or rather i suppose you have the exact idea). i've been having people over and making them sit down and just playing these beatles' albums. some react almost like a crime has been perpetrated, that they haven't heard these recordings this way before. you don't need super fancy equipment or need to listening with your "best ears" to immediately hear the enormous difference (though i'm sure some extra nice equipment would be great; i'm just highlighting that the difference is fundamental and significant no matter what your equipment is).

i had this one moment when listening to the song black bird that's very illustrative of the difference for me. there's tapping that keeps time in that song. i don't think i ever thought about what was making it. i think i just assumed it was wood block or metronome or most likely a foot tapping. the point is, i always heard the sound, but never what was making the sound. when listening to the vinyl, i didn't hear the tapping sound, i heard the palm of a hand on denim. i head denim being tapped on someone's thigh, and the slight differences when that hand landed on different parts of the curve of the leg. the guitar, wasn't the sound that an acoustic guitar makes; it was *the sound of an acoustic guitar*!  i know that all of that could sound very abstract or pretentious or even self-deceiving, but i assure anyone that one listen is all you need.

there were details in the production of every song on every album that i'd never heard or that previously weren't prominent. instruments given focus they never previously had. each one given its own physical space, on some tracks individual drums each given their own space. 

i have no words for it, except i feel like fool and i could not share the love enough. it hasn't been hard either. previously skeptical or disinterested friends have been left in flabbergast, and that's just in who i've dragged over in a little over a week. i gave no lectures or technical details (unless they asked after the fact); all i had to do was sit people down and play the music. it's going to be a long and expensive road rebuilding some of the most important parts of my music collection, but it's well worth the effort ahead.

previously when asking vinyl collectors what the deal is i've only ever gotten very glib responses that never expanded past simply stating, "it just sounds better." my reaction to that, with no offer to actually hear it or solid explanations of possible technical reasons, always left me feeling along the lines of, "yeah right, you just like the idea of having a record collection," or "if you think it sounds better it just some kind of nostalgia for old things rather than actual sound quality." i never properly looked into it on my own, nor did anyone simply do me the favor of just saying, "let's listen to a record." 

if anyone who loves vinyl knows people who love music but don't get the vinyl thing, please, save the talk and just have them over for a good old fashioned music day. it seems no one spends enough time just listening to music while not doing anything else these days anyways given the prominence of listening on portable players, in cars or on the computer. just sitting on the couch and listening to a good record on decent speakers is all it should take to convert anyone.
i'd really recommend starting off with a pandora radio station playing that album, or the flaming lips.
reccomendations:blonde redhead ("misery is a butterfly" might be closer to yoshimi). the magnetic fields "69 love songs"
the firey furnaces "gallowsbird's bark".

if you hate all these records you could try out  built to spill and see if that's more your size. 


i was hoping for the whole musical, but one track is still nice. i can't really complain about something new from the world's loudest band.

on a somewhat unrelated note, is it unethical that i used a 10 minute mail account to access the track? i kind of feel bad about it, since it was essentially a case of quid pro quo, my email for the track, and i went and made up a fake one.
i agree. _underneath the weeping willow_ is a personal favorite.
i can't believe noone's mentioned mercury rev, 'deserter songs' is a gorgeous album.
this album got me through high school. i wish they didn't disband
look at the top comment in that thread....

look at your submission titled.

look at the webpage.

i see the word tab describing a website specifically for chord transcriptions.

i don't think you're going to win over many people from the previous submission.
the meeting of you two here on this thread is just adorable.
neutral milk hotel's in the aeroplane over the sea is an album you will play again and again and again...
i'm a huge steve reich fan, but on what planet is his work anything like the flaming lips'?
there's another track on the website (no reg. needed). bril.
what? if you don't like it, say why.
no, just because no other album reminds me of the funny stunning 6ft tall blonde girl i was dating at the time... :(
she would sing along to all the songs while she dance-drove her jeep.
&gt;well alex mclean  has hacked haskell enough to create a techno programming language.

isn't "hacking" the art of getting around a deliberate obstruction, or making something do something it wasn't intended to? now, isn't the *point* of a programming language to let you do whatever you want? i've never gotten the whole "hacking a language" thing... to me, it's not hacking, it's merely a very clever implementation.
is there a flac sample of this i could procure somehow for my curious ears and  my 5.1 sound system.
have you ever wondered how elgar's pomp &amp; circumstance march no. 1 came to be associated with commencement ceremonies? richard smith of the elgar society can explain.
i'm really surprised no one has mentioned the shins (as far as i've seen) but that's definitely another band i listen to when i'm in the mood to listen to the lips. 

these bands don't necessarily sound really similar to the flaming lips but they create the same mood for me at least: wilco, the strokes (particularly first impressions of earth), some modest mouse songs, neutral milk hotel, elliott smith, and built to spill.

if you're looking for things a lot like the lips i would definitely start with the shins, wilco, and built to spill. hope those work for you.
i still don't really get the lips that much.. i mean, there are certain songs i think are wonderful, 'do you realise??' for example but... none of their albums have grabbed me yet.

still, i'm guessing you'd like animal collective's latest album (maybe 2007's strawberry jam by them too, although it's a little more 'difficult', took me ages to get it.)

the newest super furry animals album, dark days/light years, has a similar style to the flaming lips in places and is pretty damn good, you should check it out.



i disagree. i hacked perl the other day to create a cgi form processing script. the week before i hacked django to create quick 'n' dirty cms for a newspaper.

glad to see hacking lives on.
hah! how about tchaikovsky for 4th of july? ahhh america...
i was going to recommend animal collective as well.  [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zol2mjf6xne) from their newest album is great.
the tapping sound is a metronome, not a hand on denim though. [source](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=157)

edit: see my reply below, it's not a metronome
well, a. i feel like an idiot.

b. i stand by everything i'm trying to convey about this. it sounds like a hand on denim in a very real way to me. the fact that it's not that is a mistake on my part, but there is no mistaking that the sound has a clarity and nuance to it i had never heard before and that you hear it as a sound being made by physical object rather than just a sound on  recording. i must say i'm astounded it's a metronome. i only look forward all the more to giving it another listen to later today. it has muted softness and slight lack of consistency to the texture of it that made me think denim on a leg.

anyways, thank you for the correction, and i'm always excited to learn some good beatles' lore,  i only hope that my mistake doesn't dissuade the skeptical from at least giving vinyl a good chance with their own ears.

i probably sound like a over-zealous loon even to vinyl supporters; i'm just excited i guess. but ultimately the message i want to convey is that those who have never bothered should try just spending a bit of time with some nice records if they can, and i believe if they do, it will not take a stretch of the imagination or particularly fancy equipment to be very very impressed and taken by the difference.
check out "songs for dustmites"by steve burns. yes, it really is the original steve from blue's clues - but was recorded right around the same time as yoshimi at the lips' studio with various band members producing / contributing. 

i'd also recommend dukes of stratusphear - their 'anthology' combines their two studio releases 'psonic psunspot' and 'chips from the chocolate fireball' this was the group xtc's more overtly psychedelic alter-ego in the mid-80's.  this and the xtc albums from the same time period "skylarking" (expertly produced by todd rundgren) and "oranges and lemons" are well worth revisiting in the pop-psychedelia genre.
where can i download that? i'll pay for it even.
the interesting thing is that the austrians have persuaded the world that mozart was austrian and hitler was german.

just for accuracy.  i agree, though, it's a great album.

i also listen to under the western freeway (their prior album) a whole lot.
those are some great suggestions, especially the kleptones remix.

ive got nothing to add here that hasn't already been said, but i wanted to comment so i could find this again and take advantage of all the recommendations.

crunchy blues tone
excellent, smithers.
well... i suppose there is both rhythm and sound.  you're right, i mis-read the question... or rather neglected to read it all together. 
nuts, all albums i should have recommended.  nicely done!
ok, my stomach can't take much more of this.

ears can detect sound up to ~20khz. that's pretty much for a healthy young teenager who hasn't been exposed to much loud noise. by the time you're 20, you'll be hard pressed to hear anything at 20khz, and if you do, it'll be greatly diminished.

now here's an important thing: you can't detect the difference between a sine wave and any other shape (square, triangle, sawtooth, etc.) above ~10khz. any non-sinusoidal wave consists of a sine wave at the fundamental frequency, and harmonics at frequencies above it. the first harmonic is double the frequency, so the difference between (say) a 12khz sawtooth wave and a 12khz sine wave is entirely at or above 24khz. you can't hear it! the arguments about losing wave shapes at high frequencies are specious, because you can't hear the wave shape at high frequencies.

also, vinyl is far from "the exact end user/listener manifestation of what the album production teams decision making process". once all of the decisions and choices have been made, resulting in a two-track master, the signal goes through a massive additional eq (de-emphasizing bass and emphasizing the treble by as much as 20db!), then is physically cut onto a slab of modestly stable material (vinyl), with a linear cutting stylus, susceptible to the whims of the the environment. playback then consists of a pivoting stylus trying to reproduce the vibrations (again, subject to the whims of the environment), and then passing it through the inverse eq filter to recover the bass (and massively amplify rumble and hum at the same time).

don't get me wrong--i have more invested in my turntable (rega table with goldring cart) and vinyl than most people, and i love it. but any claims that vinyl is more accurate or closer to the 'real' sound are completely wrong.

you keep wandering into dangerous territory.  there are technical reasons why vinyl is superior.  i won't argue that.  but as soon as you start throwing around words like 'texture', credibility starts to slip.

placebo is powerful.

if you want to do real comparison, you should do some abx testing.  this double-blind procedure cuts out the placebo effect.  you'd need software to control it, but you should be able to source vinyl and say cd of the same music.  i wouldn't doubt in the slightest if you can tell them apart.  i highly doubt if you could tell a 192kbps vbr mp3 from the cd source, however.

edit: just to be clear, i strongly believe in vinyl, especially as it is free from the over compression and 'loudness wars' that cd production is suffering from.
i always thought granddaddy's "software slump" album was really similar. it has the same warm synth sound, though overall its not as good as the lips...way more "indie rock"...still, it has that sorta concept album vibe going for it too. check it out!
oh, and if you're really enjoying the lips, find a copy of zaireka. that one's always fun to listen to when done properly (ie, with 4 cd players...if you dont know what i'm talking about, look it up.)
shit! i just suggested the same! those two albums are pretty similar in an odd way.
i disagree with that being the best lips album, but totally agree about the other stuff.
the camera work was well done and the timing was impeccable which is a sign of great direction but i wouldn't say it is the best. 
or in rare cases, elegant-yet-cagey-and-unusually-constructed.
hack is also a pop culture term that can mean "using something in a way that it isn't normally used"
most people seem to be shocked when they find this out, i've always wondered what the big deal is.
i agree, but i'm trying to teach myself the drums so tabs are the easiest way.
[my favorite genre of music]
actually the thing that put me back onto cds and flac in the first place is how easily i've (seemingly) been able to pick-out distortion in cymbals and other higher end sounds and how sustained some instruments sound, like they're being cut-off too soon. also, the amount of "space" between instruments feels and sounds great and more defined with the cds than the mp3s, but i understand that's not exactly technical objective speech there. 

i have done direct comparisons of cds and vinyl as well as cds and mp3 under blind circumstances, but not double-blind nor in any actually controlled atmosphere designed for proper objective testing; it was just for fun/personal interest.

i'll be the first to agree with you though about the nature of placebo which fueled my previous skepticism regarding uncompressed music, and would enjoy trying a proper double blind. when i say "texture", i realize you're right, that i'm speaking in very abstract and subjective terms.

my experience has felt so exciting for me in part because i wasn't expecting the difference to be noticeable at all never mind as positive as it's been, so i really surprised myself. 

aside from the content of my ranting what prompted me to rant as such is my extremely strong recommendation that people take the extra time or effort if possible to just try it out. i think most will be pleased with the results. so i suppose i would say to ignore my poor attempts at waxing poetic about the experience, but take the level of emotion invoked in me as encouragement to give it a try for oneself.

**edit:** i think i need to drop this subject now, as i'm not getting any work done reading and writing about it.

anyhow, i'm only putting that out there in case anyone else responds with more thoughtful and interesting comments, and i don't write back, it's not because i'm ignoring their view-point or am not interested, but because i need to forcibly shut-down reddit for a bit.
if no style of music has ever appealed to you, you are either a troll or dead inside. 
a lot of bands are not good live, or don't believe in selling their image.
&gt; most people seem to be shocked when they find this out,i've always wondered what the big deal is.

look at it this way: everyone else does. so ya, it's bizarre.
i don't feel dead inside at all, i'm not particularly weird or introverted either.
i go through phases.  its generally always transmissions or the soft bulletin though.

but for no music to evoke an emotion from you, to me is impossible.  i listen to a lot of different music.  i do have a specific genre that i listen to but i listen to a wide range due to there being talented musicians in every genre.

let me ask this have you only ever listened to music that is played on the radio?  or do you try to seek out something that would actually appeal to you?
what baout it?
try listening to all kinds of music go beyond typical rock, rap, country etc...you are sure to find something that you like. 


i don't have the technical background to support or contest much in either direction.

my experience listening to these vinyl recordings is that they are very different and much improved. if that improvement is not the actual frequency depth, could it be simply that these vinyl copies are mastered or mixed differently in a way in which they sound more dynamic and have  greater clarity between the various instruments tracks? 

i'm not trying to argue or be rhetorical, i'm genuinely curious, because there is no doubt that the vinyl copies of these beatles' albums i'm hearing sound distinctly different from i've been hearing for years on cd, and it's a difference that to my ear sounds remarkably better. what exactly that difference is, and why for me it makes it sound "better" is what i'm hoping to learn if is not, as you say, the resolution of sound.

i am certain i can hear a difference with the vinyl. i'm certain i like it. others i'm exposing to it agree. the instruments seem more clear and distinct in their "space" and volume. it's almost like you can tell where the microphones were placed. do you think this is in my head (i'm not at all suggesting it could not be the case) or is there some other quality at work here? 

(i'm already breaking a rule i made to drop this subject on this thread because it's all i've been doing all morning so if i don't respond to any response you might be kind enough to give me, please don't think i haven't read it and given it thoughtful consideration.)  
well, what i think he is asking is "do certain noises appeal to you, like rain, birds or maybe white noise?"

there is a sub genre that uses random noises as a form of music, most notably would be electronic music and metal genres.
i've listened to music all over the palce from every genre.
and nothing you have ever listened to has ever evoked an emotion from you?

edit: can you list a sampling of artists or songs you have listened to?

that is the whole point when it comes to music, to tell a story and evoke an emotion.  i can understand not liking a particular style or genre but to never really enjoy a song is just a really foreign concept to me. 
&gt;and nothing you have ever listened to has ever evoked an emotion from you?

pretty much.
&gt;well, what i think he is asking is "do certain noises appeal to you, like rain, birds or maybe white noise?"

i like the sound of rain at night, lulls me to sleep ^_^
well this sent me down a horribly unproductive path.  now i'm playing around with trackers, pretending that i'm jonny greenwood.


sweet
wow, just wow.
i could list composers and artists to listen to but that wouldn't really do much, help or convince you.
it just seems to me that you have not come across a genre or artist that you like.
what i can suggest is keep listening and don't limit yourself to radio or what you hear on tv or in movies.  if your not an introvert like you state talk to your friends and listen to everything that they have.  
idk, i just can't fathom that there is someone that doesn't enjoy music. 
yeah, i'll second steve burns's album sounding a lot like *yoshimi*-era flaming lips. i don't have the whole album, just three or four tracks i downloaded back in the napster days.

also, i wasn't aware that the guys from xtc had a side project. thanks for the heads up!
&gt;talk to your friends and listen to everything that they have.

it's funny, one of my friends is an obsessive music lover, he listens to everything and loves it all, he's been trying to convince me for a while now but has lulled off lately.

i'll ask him again maybe?
actually, i just went back and read the source i linked to, and it's not a metronome, they scratched the master.  i'll have to go back and listen to it now.  i had always assumed it was a metronome.
the starlight mints sound closer to earlier lips than the neo-psychedelia of *yoshimi*, but the op would do well to check them out.
it helps if you have a basic understanding of music theory. most popular songs are written with fairly standard chord progressions (for instance, the ole i-iv-v progression is ubiquitous) and knowing these rules, you have an easier time remembering where the song is going "next". 

another thing that is important is being able to distinguish the difference between notes very well. for example, two notes that form a perfect 4th (or 5 semitones) such as that found on the first and second strings when you play a e-major shape bar chord:
   
0 &lt;---     
0 &lt;---   
1  
2  
2  
0  

it is good to be able to instantly recognize this interval, and all of the other semitone intervals as well. thinking about the notes in a particular riff in terms of intervals (rather than numbers on a tab) will help to make it easier to play by ear. 

one other thing that helps is being able to identify a specific note (or chord) just from memory (aka "perfect pitch"). this perhaps takes the most work, and i think some people might not ever be able to quite get there (my mom is pretty tone deaf). i'm still working on this, mostly i just go by intervals. maybe identifying individual notes is a bit much, but at least try to be able to hear the difference between an e minor chord and an a minor chord, for example. 

i was pretty slow and relied upon tabs initially, but now i'm pretty confident that what i'm playing matches up well to what i'm hearing. hopefully with practice you can slow guitar solos down in your head and start to piece together how it's being played. however, software to slow down music without changing the pitch is widely available and i'd highly recommend using that to help. 
the soft bulletin is better by miles. pick it up.
that's one of those songs where the concept is way better than the execution
if you get anywhere close to what johnny does, let us hear it :)
it's fine man. all of us dislike something that's "common enjoyment".

i don't like dancing, or painting. i gain absolutely zero enjoyment from doing them, watching them or listening to amazing stories about them. no painting or dance has ever invoked a genuine emotional response from me.

i also enjoy video games a lot, especially jrpg's. i know lots of people who hate those and i really have difficulty seeing why sometimes. that's just the way life is.. we're all different.

i've known lots of people who just don't enjoy music, and i think it's perfectly normal. even if i make my living as a musician.
the only work of madonna's that has really been deemed credible was actually the work of william orbit. like a virgin was written by billy steinberg and tom kelly, into the groove was written by stephen bray, like a prayer was written by patrick leonard etc.

you should also be aware, that when you buy the rights to music you can legally claim that you wrote it yourself.
kludge means inelegant

smoke pot and try listening to a few classically popular albums.
he's a serial killer.
hey, that's my favorite genre of music too!
"oh man, you mean you've never blank blank blankity blank?"

you're dead right.  some people just don't like certain things.

dance also does nothing for me (unless you count pressing close to a girl and moving in slow circles).  i don't enjoy operas, or seafood.  everyone's different.
it might be that you haven't had the proper doorways opened in your mind.  this seems to happen to most folks when they are young or with drug experimentation but if you weren't exposed then those doors would probably still be closed.  certain circumstances can also trigger responses; ie social interaction, states of relaxation, lighting and other visual stimulus, unfamiliar settings etc.  these can make us experience things in different ways including the way we experience music.  
not sure if you would be interested since you can't see the benefit but maybe expose yourself to different settings that include music as a focal point.  i would suggest steering clear of the pop/mainstream selections.  dig a little deeper, it could be worth the effort.
so technically this makes it a live show right?
s-s-soft bu-bulletin better than yoshimi!?
do you realize is like, one of my favorite songs, period. 
however old you are, i doubt at this point anyone is going to help change your mind.


on a side note, i've always imagined that the type of person that doesn't enjoy music whatsoever is the same person that as a child tortures small animals and grows up to murder/rape people. not that you're a person like this, but it's the first thing i thought of.
your music isn't hardcore, and you don't belong on reddit.

this is way more than drivel. it's embarrassing. i thought this was a lonely island parody at first. silly me, i thought a pretentious prick like you would enjoy picking it apart. i believe i remember similar terrible being laughed at on the front page only weeks ago. i'd recommend visiting to the funny subreddit so you can chill the fuck out. good day sir.

i listen to anything but that genre of music.  i find i have no cultural connection to the lyrics/beat/melody/harmonization/etc.
i should think the word you wanted was "shameless". well, i haven't listened to your music yet, so maybe i'm wrong...

the kind of negative instant reaction you had with the you don't belong on reddit comment really shows that you sir, are the one that doesn't belong.
yep. cold?
" . . . could it be simply that these vinyl copies are mastered or mixed differently in a way in which they sound more dynamic and have greater clarity between the various instruments tracks?"

yes!  look into the [loudness war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loudness_war) this is the only reason vinyl today typically sounds better than pcm (cd audio).  also check out the [vinyl myths](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=vinyl_myths) section on the hydrogenaudio wiki.

tl;dr version:  modern theory in mastering is that louder = better.  this has been pushed so far that many modern cds sound horrible.  due to limitations of the vinyl medium records are incapable of reproducing the extra loud (dynamically compressed) sound that is mastered to their cd equivalents. 
under most circumstances, listening to music is purely recreational entertainment. if you don't enjoy it, that's all there is to be said about it. you don't enjoy music. i don't enjoy watching nascar. it's ok. 

i feel no need to convince you otherwise. but if you think you'd like to enjoy music and don't know how get yourself 'into' it, consider learning to play an instrument. this might provide an element that has otherwise been missing...just a thought.
[hey ya - scrubs version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxgqfmuse7m)
operating under the assumption that you are not trolling... please try this experiment.  get a halfway decent stereo and a copy of beethoven's ninth.  sit down in a darkened room with no distractions and play the music.  close your eyes, concentrate fully on it for the length of the piece (surely in your life you can give music *this* much undivided attention).  *how* you listen is up to you, you can try to pick out individual instruments and follow their thread through the piece, or you can just let the whole wash over you in waves.

give it just this much time and this much of you undivided attention, and if you can truly report back and say that you felt *nothing*,  well then, truly your brain is wired differently than mine in a way that i have never imagined was possible before.

i feel a little unsettled and anxious right now to tell you the truth....
ennio morricone? dudes a badass, but he's like 80. you sure it's really him :p?
good call on yoshimi. my first experience with the lips and i loved it. definitely expanded my horizons for that type of music- kinda ambient, but still melodic, and put together as a whole album and not just individual songs. anyway here are a couple of my other favorites along those lines:

the two which probably come the closest:  
**air**: moon safari (or any of their others, for that matter)  
**mercury rev**: all is dream and the secret migration (their new one is interesting too...)

some other highly recommended ones:  
**m83**: before the dawn heals us  
**super furry animals**: love kraft  
**the eels**: blinking lights and other revelations

maybe a little less what you're looking for, but still a good listen:  
**the orb**: adventures beyond the ultraworld  
**royksopp**: the understanding  
**the secret machines**: ten silver drops  
**sigur ros**: takk  
**zero 7**: the garden

and some old classics:  
**pink floyd**: particularly wish you were here and momentary lapse of reason  
**the moody blues**: on the threshold of a dream and in search of the lost chord

fwiw, if you live on the west coast (or are willing to fly out, which is totally worth it), the coachella festival is great for this type of music. a lot of these bands i first learned about there.

some people use the 2 interchangeably... yes i agree a tab version would be cool but as far as i know this is the best there is yet.
why would we try to convince you otherwise?
i particularly enjoy not just operas and seafood, but operas about seafood.
or a few popularly classical albums. either way.
interesting... great concept, though it seems somewhat unpredictable (refresh/resize the window, and you get an entirely different map, at least as far as how the secondary artists are spaced out in relationship to each other). but that'd be a great comp-sci project: given a relationship between each of 50 or so items, sort them in a way to optimize the 2-d layout between them all. even more interesting would be a 3-d map. anyway i'm being nerdy here...
now i feel like an asshole for my "shameless" comment. you are right, igkunow, to point out ungentlemanly behavior here on reddit.

first and foremost, you have to ask about the mastering of the various albums. when miles davis' "kind of blue" was first released on cd, it sounded terrible. the '86 "remaster" was worse. then in '92, it was remastered (well, this time!), and speed-corrected on side 1 to fix a problem in the original studio masters, and lo--brilliance revealed! many people had slightly draggy turntables had heard this correctly before, but nobody with a cd had before 1992.

"digitally remastered" was often a curse-phrase in the audiophile circles for a while, with good reason. ultimately, digital in the studio is a different beast entirely, and took some learning.

now, take a really well-mastered cd and a  comparable record of the same piece. the vinyl will clearly have a certain 'airiness' that the cd lacks. if you'd like, i can reproduce it for you: adding in some low-level (about -75db) random noise will create much of it. blend the two channels a bit to emulate crosstalk, maybe add a slight bit of rumble and some 60hz hum, and voila--that natural vinyl sound! :-)

another thing to consider is that very little new music is recorded in a live environment. most is done by recording individual instruments in an anechoic chamber, and then mixing it all down into synthetic stereo. a lot of the acoustic queues to indicate position are lost. having some noise added back in doesn't re-add them, but gives the illusion that they're there.

hunting down some really good 'live' mixed music (or even better, direct to two-track--tricky to do, though!) will give you an example of what cds really _can_ sound like, with sufficient attention to detail. cowboy junkie's "trinity sessions" is the first one that comes to mind.

i also have a pet theory (totally untested) that the way we hear music changes our creation of it. bjork, for instance is really meant to be as utterly clean and flawless as the best of technology. late '60s rock was made by driving marshall stacks through the roof and then overdriving the (tube) recording gear on top of it; and trying to clean up the recording too much loses something.

put another way, certain music is suited for certain studio 'styles', either ultra-clean (digital) or noisy and full of distortion (analog). perfect example, now that i think of it, was tubular bells i and ii, by mike oldfield. the original was an experiment in music development and track overlays. he worked so hard at it that you can hear bits where the tape was wearing thin as he tried to get one more instrument onto it! it's a masterpiece.

on the second album, he revisited the same themes and concepts, but did it all in a digital studio. it just feels 'wrong.' you can't hear the sweat and effort that he put into the original. (yes i know, totally subjective and vague--go listen to 'em and see if you disagree with me, though :-)

basically, what a cd is good at is precisely reproducing two tracks of audio fed onto it. nothing more, nothing less. if the engineers were counting on 'something more' from the playback side, it may be unbalanced without it.


i do absolutely love the shit out of do you realize, but when you think about it, it's sentiment is quite similar to mike and the mechanics "in the living years"
try sparklehorse if you like the flamming lips
jason lytle (their singer) has just released a solo album called *yours truly, the commuter*
joe nice.
oh and if you aren't already familiar with them, get **arcade fire**'s two albums.
itunes music store also pays the artist $7 for an album sale
the best introductions are the dubstep allatars series (might want to give 4&amp;5 a miss though) and the tectonic plates 1 &amp; 2 compilations. 

artist-wise, burial, skream, benga, kode 9 and pinch all have good full albums, but a lot of artist albums only have a few good tracks.
bands that can't offer a good live performance need to find another gimmick then.  with the constant progress of technology, we can't expect for all the old-world rules to still work the same.  the us ip laws today are mostly based off the 1910 player pianos that where believe where going to kill off the live music business.
a different sound, but with a similar upbeat psychedelic sensibility is mr. robyn hitchcock (who has toured with the lips), particularly his '80s and '90s work and his stint with the soft boys.
also, check out /r/dubstep...
that's because you haven't heard [my favorite band from that particular genre of music].

you should totally check them out!
though the butthole influence is patently obvious for live performances, their actual influence on records like yoshimi is probably hard to understand on a one to one basis (though, yes, you should try anything by them if you haven't already). 

people can't get enough of that damn wilco record - i heartily second it's nomination. 
air is awfully derivitive if you have just discovered the flaming lips you should bypass this and go straight for stereolab - "emperor tomato ketchup" is a nice starting point.  while i'm here adding more suggestions if you like this you will probably also like yo la tengo's "i can still hear the beating of the heart"  

the pink floyd is one of the best selling artists in the history of pop music. if you're not already familiar with them - you should probably start with listening to dark side of the moon. 
this is honestly the best recommendation for sounds like flaming lips on this thread... though i would point to "al sharp" 
i saw that too earlier today. similar thoughts echoed. 
though this is the most important album in the whole damn genre (and absolutely one of the most perfect records in the rememberable history).  for flaming lips fans it might be a hard sell - but if you can get into it: yes. yes. yes. 
"oranges and lemons" is a little tricky - i'd kind of point to "skylarking" or "english settlement" as starter records. 
i don't mind giving it up to these guys, however i may live to regret it one day.
hoooooly shiitttt
he's from the paleolithic ;)  maybe the sound of fire being started is what he needs to get going.
man, i write a piece blasting live nation and sticking up for music lovers, and i'm getting downmoded to death. tough crowd. 
still trying to get the sounds of 50-cent and lil' john out of my head.
i agree with many of the suggestions here, but wanted to throw out something a little different. **cafe tacuba** is a spanish rock band, and they're up there with the beatles in my opinion. check out [eres](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzdbdxnpk_0).
hack the planet
i love these guys. that is all.
that's right. any objections? your comparison to yeats makes much less sense.

also gonna point out that you were the one who started the smart-assery on this one. i would be interested to know what crazybones has to say, and what prompted him to post this to begin with. mccartney has as much right as anyone to state his opinion, and if anything it makes the bbc look like a fascist corporation (heh....) for banning it. 

and just a side note - you might wanna learn to correctly spell the names of the people you are ridiculing. it will make you look less like a loser. you have done nothing in this post except insult me and someone who most likely has made a much better living than you could ever hope to, good lyricist or not. what do you give to the world besides insults? would you have the guts to release something you felt strongly about to the world, rather than ranting about it in your little corner of the web? fail.
yes, i also like real rock, real indie, real etc.., except i don't actually call them that. what's the deal with putting the word "real" in front of a genre? sounds kinda elitist.
great song, but did anyone else notice the video editing mistake near the middle?
if you like people under the stairs, give [ugly duckling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msoklzdpqmw) a listen :)
the real in this case is because people wrongly put many types of rap under the label "hip-hop", when it's not. whereas artists like the roots, common, mos def are hip-hop, you'll see people referring to people like ludacris or *random rap artist here* as hiphop artists
what things in your life do you have passion for ? (perhaps if we knew, we could draw similarities and suggest some music that tickles the same area)
why the luda hate?
i'm seeing them in two weeks, at bonnaroo. i really can't wait.

if you like "real hiphop" as you put it, check out [from the corner to the block](http://www.amazon.com/corner-block-galactic/dp/b000sm7qwk) by galactic. an amazing hip hop album by itself, it also acts as a list of some of the best underheard rappers around.
oh don't get me wrong luda is in my top three favorite rappers, he's a lyrical wordsmith muthafuckin genius, but he's not "hip hop" (although his cadence is obviously very hip hop influenced)
[real hip hop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxtim9d8i-o). puts is the tits though. wish i could go.
i just saw puts and ugly duckling together. ugly duckling is good, however they seemed like they didn't really know how to put on a show.
not like it would matter anyway; there is so many plugins to scrobble from sources to make the riaa think it was an album leak you downloaded from a torrent network anyway. people should have had a red flag thrown up as soon as they seen the slanderous article.
pot affects different people differently.
i'm sorry but i just dont understand you.
all points west!
because akon is marketed as hip hop, and whatever he is, he is not hip hop.
i'd never even heard of that. gogol bordello live would be soooooo awesome.  looks great.  i"m going to be in san diego those days tho, shit.
its ok since my friends favorite band is nickelback, which some would argue is tantamount to hating music
got my 3 day pass to lollapalooza! goin for tool and coheed
can someone explain in qualitative, objective terms what differentiates real hip-hop from regular hip-hop?
souljaaaa boiiii






jk
bonnaroo is looking great at the moment.  my schedule if you're interested: http://mindreader.bonnaroo.com/a/public/schedule?un=1217040107

lolla always seems to have a wonderful lineup in the mid tier, but from what i hear the whole atmosphere just doesn't compare to roo.  late night shows are the best part of roo, and lolla has to stop playing at 10 or 11.  bonnaroo also doesn't have to deal with volume restrictions as it's not in the middle of a city like lollapalooza.
right, but what about electronic bands? are you suggesting they start t-shirt factories and hire dancers?

imo, this is just wrong.
i personally don't believe in classifying music period. because then you end up with bs genres like *alternative* and *lifestyle*.
they're a bit too nerded out for me. not bad, though. einstein is a wiz on the tables - i always thought he was above their gimmicky shit.
i saw them live at the paradise here in boston last year. great show - especially when lif came out. i've never seen a man jump around and have as much energy on stage as boots riley. man that dude can move.
i personally have no problem with being a hip-hop snob.

i don't go door-to-door with it, but if people ask me if i've heard the new akon track, i'm more than willing to explain to them why i think it's trash.

it's not that i try to alienate people - i am constantly burning cd's for people at my work to spread the wealth. 

there's just too much *good* hip hop out there to listen to bullshit. it might take a little more digging, and some people don't know how to use the internet as a resource to find good music.
wiggity wow! i kiggity came to post the same thing.
mr lif was at the paradise show?

oh maaaaaaan. i went back and forth on whether or not to go, and i decided against. totally regretting that now. although i did see them back chali 2na at last year's bonnaroo, mr. lif would have been amazing.
being a boston hip-hop head, i've seen lif a bunch. 

he honestly puts on one of the best hip-hop shows i've ever seen. his crowd control is second to none, his mic levels are great (a credit more to the sound man) and he knows to perform *live*.

i've been to dozens and dozens of hip-hop shows over the years, and a lot of them have been a real disappointment.

think about it - a *band* is super used to playing live in front of audiences. they practice with the same equipment they perform with usually. there is little change in terms of how the songs are executed in practice and on stage.

a hip-hop act, however, does *not* perform the same way they do things in a studio. often times vocals are drowned out by poor sound, people raise their voices too much (which removes a certain quality imo). mf doom does *not* sound the same live as in the studio. he's soft-spoken, and when he's forced to raise his voice while performing, he's no longer sounds the same.
i'm just confused by the word *scrobble*
luda definitely is "hip hop". you may not like him and he may not be underground but he is definitely hip hop. if you went with soulja boy, i would agree with you. 
i'll be at the tool show (probably drunk off my ass)
when i saw this posted i was *seriously* hoping that it would be "san francisco knights". this song is too fucking good. 

another one of my faves is [tales of kid drunkadelic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkgth8narxs). it's a little silly to be sure, but its elevator-music-like background music is absolutely perfect for a song about getting trollied and being proud of it.

i actually did the write-up for the [ohhla lyrics page](http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/people_u/ost/tales_of.uts.txt)


that's cult! :-)
i love the atmosphere at bonnaroo, i just don't have a clan to go with this year. i went like 4 years ago and had the time of my life.  i want to go again but i think it might be a bit frivolous since most of the bands will be at lollapalooza.
people under the stairs rhymes are newest and best. we will show you where osama bin laden is hiding now.
i'll be at bonnaroo too! i'd link my schedule, but i have no idea how. oh, and good luck seeing julia nunes on thursday. i'd try to get there early if i were you.

every time i think of lollapalooza, i instantly think of [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6khc90csfpc), and specifically what's going on in the background. look at all that traffic *right next* to the festival. no thanks. and while i agree that late night shows are the best part of roo, i have to say, the late night schedule is a little disappointing this year. why the hell is animal collective on the which stage in the middle of the afternoon? animal collective, mars volta, grace potter, del mccoury, katzenjammer, snoop dogg, yeah yeah yeahs... all wasted late night possibilities. also, no late night superjam this year.
as much as i love metric's acoustic versions, the regular album version will always be my favorite. something about the catchy synth melody during the chorus just kicks too much ass.
awesome, thanks.
[acid rain drops!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dr1kqdggrk) my favorite song by them!
i was sitting here trying to think of a hip-hop song that i could share that maybe some people hadn't heard of that i *really* enjoyed.

[blu and exile - cold hearted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4oqu8qlsgo) is what i came up with. it may be a little too sing-songy for some hardcore hip-hop heads, but i absolutely love it. please listen to this song and let me know what you guys think.

it's usually put in front of "real rock" bands like stained, puddle of mudd, and linkin park. total shit.
best hip hop album of this decade has got to be madvillainy. but nothing beats enter the wu-tang, illmatic or ready to die.
i'm actually looking forward to this as i'm a guitar teacher and most little kids i teach seem to be inspired by video games.  there are a few decent tracks on the original rb but these are quality songs that anyone should be exposed to.  people need better musical role models these days.
i gotta drop some more puts knowledge itt:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc4psmwl07o
as does music. weed + music = awesome, for the majority of people, myself included.
i haven't been before and now i'm concerned that it might suck at times.  i hope tool is late at night, i dont think palooza has the times up yet.

mars volta at night is mind blowing.
o suck a dick, it was a joke
maybe you just don't agree with certain classifications?
one word: marijuana
yeah. real hiphop as in not the bullshit they feed the masses on tv.

ever see mobb deep, krs-one, madlib, a tribe called quest, gangstarr, black star , the roots and such on mtv?

no. they prefer 50 cent, the game, and whatever his name is...(soopaman... youuuu!!!)

and that , sir, is not real hiphop.
bonnaroo for sure! get walkie talkies. i'll be on channel 7 or something...
scour the internest to find a copy of 'smile' redone with original beach boys recordings. so very good. better than 'pet sounds', methinks.
now ill just leave a list of bands i like, (i love the lips, so maybe youll like these bands too)
myspace.com/fogeymusic (local musician i like here in seattle). bibio. low. idaho. smog (aka bill callahan). angels of light. morita doji. rodriguez. and if youre going to check out animal collective, 'sung tongs' is my favorite of their albums. i could keep going. theres soo much good music in this world
try this :  video's pretty cool too.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwlxfhmqvzu&amp;feature=related&amp;pos=2
walkie talkies are useless at bonnaroo. way too many people use them and so everyone's on the same channel.
common market is the shit.  actually the whole seattle scene is pretty sweet.  if you've heard of common market i'm guessing you know about blue scholars but if not check them out.  also check out dyme def.  they're awesome and also from seattle but definitely more in the swagger rap vein of the genre.
is rock band usually so harmony-focused? 
animal collective was my biggest late night wish.  i think we'll be fine this year with phish, nin, and whatever electronic act you choose for friday.

there will be a superjam this year according to people who have made some emails on the inforoo forums.  one rumor is that it'll be on the what stage this year.
quoting someone talking about irresponsible journalism "off the record?"  *nice*...
i highly doubt it'll be on the what stage. sunday evening other tent seems most likely, as that where it was in years past and there's a big hole in that spot on the schedule.

edit: but i don't know what that big hole in the what stage sunday morning is for. hmmm....
i'm sorry but this is one of my pet peves.  there is no such thing as "real" hip hop.  for one hip hop is a cultural movement of which rap is one of the elements (graffiti, djing/beatboxing, and breaking being the other 3).   

second just because you don't like a style of rap doesn't make it any less authentic.  i'm sure there are those who claim to listen to "real" hip hop who would write off the game, tupac or nwa as just thug rappers not worth their time.  but if you don't think that "brenda's got a baby", "the game's pain", or "fuck the police" is as deep as anything mos def, black though, or krs-one has written then you're not paying attention to the lyrics.

and if you think that don't think that "real" hip hop engages in some of the same bragging/swagger style that is prevalent in pop rap then go listen to people under the stair's "la song".  its the style of swagger rap originating from the battle that 50 cent, jay-z and others use.  and if you listen real closely you'll notice that even you're "real" hip hop artists will reference guns, money and women just like other rappers.

oh and if you don't think i the have underground rap cred to know what i'm talking about here's some music that is fire:

wake me up for monkees rock band in 2010.
no this is the first
http://bonnaroo.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=music&amp;action=display&amp;thread=18115&amp;page=1

i'm thinking it's most likely going to be sunday on the other.
i don't care for this band, but she is a babe.
listen to 80s music.

duran duran, kajagoogoo, late 80s/early 90s ministry could be helpful, too.

drum machines are unforgiving.  enjoy!
i am in the same boat as you my friend.
alright, first of all to the op: thanks for the post; i'd heard this in a friend's car, loved it but forgot to ask for the track name (pre-shazam)

but i'm going to have to agree with those posters who are hating on the *real* part of the post.  i've been thinking about it recently and it simply doesn't make sense...music is about what sounds good / makes you feel good / etc, and if it does that, who the f**k is anyone else to tell you that it's not real? 

couple of examples: 
first, someone went with 50 cent. i mean, yea, a lot of his songs might be considered top 40, but i really have a hard time believing that one of dre's proteges isn't "hip hop"

so a song sounds good in the club after a few drinks while you're up against a fine looking lady? does this mean it's not real hip hop?

i'd been guilty of this a few times; most recently, i've been hating on kanye for 808s, but i realized last week how the track amazing works so well for the advertising that the nba's been doing during the playoffs. pumps me up for the games (:'( my cavs)

to conclude: if a sufficient number of people like something, it becomes a hit. so what happens when lots of people like an underground track? is real hip hop destined to mean hip hop that no one likes? 
i just them last night. fucking insane. he sang while standing on a drum the audience was holding up.
oh. so by "real" hip hop, you mean hip hop that nobody listens to.
i like real *aussie* hiphop - hilltop hoods, etc.
uhhh first off, "being" on mtv does not mean that the music itself is trash. recently, atmosphere and aesop rock have been on mtv promoting their new albums, and along the way plugging mtv's "new" pro-hip-hop mentality. you seem to forget that without mtv's "yo! mtv rap", the various groups that you listed, and probably a boat load of groups that you couldn't, would have never made it to anyone's ears.

music doesn't cease to be music the moment it enters television or radio waves--instead if it is full of substance, meaning, message, and thought, than no medium, even mtv, can take that away from true hip hop.
i wish, god i wish i could go to roo so bad! instead i'm stuck indoors all summer, studying for the stupid bar exam. blehhh
also, real hip hop has songs about beating up gay people, but the beats have jazz flute! yahoo!
if it's widely popular among black people, it isn't hip hop.
get a metronome that you can mute but keep the beat going (such as any computer-based metronome, where you can mute your computer). count along with it, then mute and keep counting. after one measure (or more, depending on how much you want to challenge yourself and how fast the beat is), unmute it and compare your beat to the metronome's. rinse, repeat.

a decent online metronome is the aptly named http://www.metronomeonline.com/ . unfortunately, it only goes from 40-208 with no accents and only at certain given tempi.
practice slower.
[here's the other](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5njkx8obdy)
i'm headed to rothbury!
holy crap this really took off. thanks reddit!
sorry, this is awesome.
i'm a fellow crate digger.

&gt;i am constantly burning cd's for people at my work to spread the wealth.

thanks for spreading the gift of music,

&gt;some people don't know how to use the internet as a resource to find good music.

care to share? i would love to be enlightened.
the instrumental side of this game doesn't seem like it would be very much fun at all or very challenging. i'm a big beatles fan, but they weren't known for their instrumental prowess, i mean the drumming was so simplistic. the focus was always on the vocals. 
definitely. slow it down to the point of being playful, hitting each note on the right beat. slow it down so its unrecognizable and a pain to play but keep at it. this exercise is about just the timing so you'll really have to fight the urge to skip ahead but the good news is once you get the hang of this you've learned it for life.
i can tolerate a song that feels about 90 bpm down to 60bpm.  now that i think about it the one song where i felt like i got the rhythm down was even slower...simple gifts at about 50bpm.

my keyboard goes down to 40... 

thanks. :)
i can’t believe no one has mentioned the almighty immortal technique. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjp8yuebjxs
i'm just excited for 9/9/09's remastered catalog.
as a drummer, and music teacher (guitar, bass, drums, mandolin) i have this come up a lot.

of course what applies to some might not apply to everyone.

but one thing i now suggest as part of practicing to every student i teach, is that you have two types of pracitcing/playing - refinement practicing and for fun practicing.

playing songs for fun keeps you motivated, and it's always good to just let loose and play.  you shouldn't impose too many restrictions on when you just let loose.

but when you are playing to improve, always practice to a beat.  if a metronome doesn't do it for you, get a drum machine.

like people have already said, playing slowly and concentrating on hitting the beat is the key.  after you are able to do it accurately at a slow speed, speed it up.

rushing is a common thing.  professional musicians do it all the time.  in the mid 80's i noticed this when i went to a lot of concerts.  about half the shows i went to, the music was faster than the recorded music.

if you don't concentrate on the beat, you won't get it.

you could even start to learn some form of percussion if you really need help.
you sir, understand hot shit. 

that new terminology guy stole the zero 7 "in the waiting line" riff!
luda is very much influenced by hip hop and has many similarities, but he is not hip hop. hip hop artists use live instruments in their songs more often than not. that would probably be the biggest separating factor imo. luda's beats are amazing, and i love them, but they're beats...rapper beats. hip hop artists are going to use samples with affected old school east cost sounding stuff. compare common, tribe called quest, the roots, talib, and luda. their style may be similar with how they spit, but he's not really hip hop. and i don't mean to imply you have to be east cost to be hip hop, look at outkast's older stuff, in the southerplayalistic/atliens stage. very hip hop, very south


edit: as i said in another reply, i don't mean anything bad against luda, i really don't like "rap" but i'd have to put luda in my top 2 or 3 favorite rap/hip hop artists, he's a genius
i'm with you, but nothing was more authentic than an 808 before kanye started humping the damn things. 
what makes shit really real is not being 100% by, for, and about the money. 
woah dio's glasses are sick!!!
[rateyourmusic](http://rateyourmusic.com) is pretty good, especially the user [diction](http://rateyourmusic.com/~diction)
the cool kids
&gt; there is no such thing as "real" hip hop.

you are completely wrong and your next sentence points out why you're wrong. 

&gt; for one hip hop is a cultural movement of which rap is one of the elements

real hip hop is rap music that is true to the culture from which it comes. a lot of rap music today does not have any connection to or even reference the hip hop culture at all and that's why those of us who watched hip hop form say it's not real hip hop because it is completely devoid of any cultural aspects of real hip hop. 

it has nothing to do with referencing "guns, money and women" and the fact that you think that's the case shows that you don't really understand why people consider some rap to not be real hip hop.  real hip hop is rap music that has the cultural influence of the hip hop culture and those who've lived the culture can recognize it without much trouble. unreal hip hop is rap that is completely devoid of any influence of the hip hop culture, see soulja boy. 
for those interested in these matters: take look at c-sound, supercollider or saol. 
fallon sucks!!!!!!!!!!!
don't even have to watch this to up vote.

emily is so gorgeous in several ways.

[mr arrington could not be reached for comment.](http://codehappy.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/arringtoncigar.png)


so now you're saying rap artists aren't hip-hop artists?
i agree with what you're saying, but i think you're taking a stance against points that no one is really making. 

is this a response to a particular comment, or a broad-brush attack against people that claim they know what "real" hip-hop is?

i may not be able to define what "real" hip-hop is (i will salute you if you can).

that said: i *certainly* know what is *not* "real" hip-hop when i see it. hip-hop is a constantly evolving culture, no question - but there are certain elements of rap culture that are *not* real hip-hop.

again: i agree with you, but you're fighting with ghosts here. no one said that braggadocio rap wasn't real hip hop, etc.
to me it's the old school stuff, like grandmaster flash &amp; the furious five. it's been 27 years and still no one has even come close to making a hip-hop song as good as [*the message*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4o8teqkhgy). 
why would everyone be on the same channel? decent walkie talkies can tune to different frequencies, and besides, you aren't using them for in depth conversations, just "i'm dosing at the tent now, join me." or "public enemy is on in fifteen, be there."
yeah, there are like ~22 channels right? and when 400 people bring walkie-talkies, guess what happens?
don't forget nickleback.
wu-tang clan ain't nothing to fuck with!!!
wu-tang is forever
in many cases, yes.  in some cases, no.
pop
on one hand, i appreciate your pragmatism and lack of pretense.

however, mtv has seen a real decline in quality of music starting in about 1995.  this decline hit bottom in around 1998.  i don't know what mtv has done after that.  i only watched on occasion after 95, and swore off it entirely in 1998.

i don't think there would be much to that song without it.  i don't appreciate people taking songs that are pretty good and making them worse so they can speak over them to repeat the same shit everyone else is saying.

edit: however the first link, the dio song, is fucking awesome.
i'm disturbed by how many people honestly believed techcrunch based on such weak information.

meanwhile, techcrunch are _still_ deleting comments left by people who doubt or refute their claim. why are people boycotting cbs and last.fm and not techcrunch?

i have no problem calling hiphop artists rappers, but i would never say that lil' john was hip hop
im glad someone gave me a link to a great show. getting into acoustic performances really shows who can play well and who can really make music.
one of my favorites man, reason why i asked reddit this thread. if there is a show who can out-do alice in chains, i want to see it!
&gt;the drumming was so simplistic

thats really vague, while i agree the majority of the songs are simple but they don't have to be hard to be fun.

i'l take any beatles song over through the fire and flames.
[i'm not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cd_loudness_trend-something.gif)
that's just not true. i can tell your a hip hop fan but i think you might be a little confused on certain things. hip hop was built on the sample. dj's in the 70's use to take a break beat from a record and replay it over and over again creating a new song while they were live on stage, aka "juggling a beat". in the 80's people use to make pause tapes by doing the same thing except with cassette tapes but not live on stage. just because puffy(i refuse to call him diddy) abused the sample in the late 90's doesn't make it a bad thing. by the way all of those rappers that you mentioned were real hip hop all used samples in their music. especially tribe called quest. their specialty was finding old obscure jazz samples and creating songs out of them. even the roots have used some sampling in their music.

hip hop is an umbrella with all different types of styles. back in the day kid n play was considered just as much hip hop as big daddy kane. tribe called quest was just as much hip hop as black moon. just two different styles. i was joking about soulja boy in my last comment, he's part of hip hop, just very bad hip hop. 
i can dream, can't i?
&gt;i agree with what you're saying, but i think you're taking a stance against points that no one is really making.

i agree 100%. it's a well written post, but he's tilting at windmills. a little bit like an argument of "who's the realest hip hop fan".

&gt;if you are good at concealing laughter and contempt, you should ask a white person about “real hip hop.”  they will quickly tell you about how they don’t listen to “commercial hip hop” (aka music that black people actually enjoy), and that they much prefer “classic hip hop.”

i first saw them perform this live, on conan. they were great. 
some of those were pretty interesting.  i was happy that i knew a couple of them already, especially the death cab one.
wow, there's some nostalgia.

there is a lot of discussion on here of what is "real" hip-hop and what isn't.  i've been involved in many arguments about genres and come to realization that it just doesn't matter.  i know genres are a nice way of talking about music with people, but arguing about what is and what isn't in a specific genre is pointless. it's a personal thing.  just talk about what you like and what you don't like, you don't have to trash a band because "its not real [insert genre here]".  just say they suck and move on.  it's a lot more constructive to talk about style, musical elements and so on than to get into a pissing match about genres.

more precise, as far as i understand it, the guy came up with a theory that says that every instant, every "choice" ever made results in a new branch of a parallel universe.

so all the time, for every uncertainty that is made concrete (the uncertainty aspect of qm comes into mind), parallel universes are created for all the possible results that are *not* concrete in our specific branch of parallel universes.

so in essense, everything that ever happened, also never happened in some other parallel universe, and everything that never happened, also happened in some other parallel universe. we just get an infinite amount of parallel universes, constantly branching into more, until eternity.
i think rags to rags (from the same album) is better, but that's just my opinion...

i take offense to the idea that linkin park and green day are some of my favorite bands
they've announced there will be full albums as dlc, with abbey road as the first.
it really bothers me that a lot of people see the eels as a one hit wonder with this song.  every single eels album has been great.  they are one band that i'm dying to see and yet they never seem to come to new york anymore. sadly, i missed the city hall show.  ugh!
there isn't a video for that track.
i was an ingrade 
um. couldn't resist but mentioning it - the shins chronology isn't perfect and i can't imagine what else is sort of lazily off the mark in that roundup. sure, james might have started off in "blue roof diner" but three of the four guys in life jackets in that picture played together in a band that was called flake for years and years and years (the other guy in the picture, dave hernandez played in a band called scared of chaka which was big in japan for a time). after a release on slumberland records it turned out that there were a whole bunch of bands with the name "flake" (i think they lost the contest to a band from arizona) - at this point they changed their name to "flake music."  then, when james broke up flake music in a bid to do just exactly what he wanted, he formed the shins and played with a spat of various musicians until the original members of flake rejoined him. it wasn't until later on that dave rejoined the shins, kind of nicely completing the loop.

&gt; "i had to do it. jimi was worth much more to me dead than alive," jeffrey is quoted as telling wright. "that son of a bitch was going to leave me. if i lost him, i'd lose everything."

if that's true (i hope it isn't), then jeffery has got to be one of the biggest, most selfish assholes to have ever lived.  he robbed the world of one of the greatest musicians it has ever known just so he could make a couple bucks.  what a cunt.
ever hear that young phillipeeno chicken?
&gt;uh, not so great, actually non-existant, but i have a beat up ibanez ex-350 that i am going to practice on. 

um. you may need quite a lot of practice.

if you're taking it to a pro, why not get a quote for the work? someone who knows what they're doing could do it in a tenth of the time (and it'll work).

it will cost money, of course - but the potential value might well make it worth while.
and they waited over 30 years to tell anyone?
it's funny that they're perceived as a one-hit wonder from your perspective - and you're probably right. amongst my friends, we saw an anime music video for last stop: this town and immediately started buying their albums. naturally, electro-shock blues became the favorite because of that song, but with a less mainstream entry point, we got into the band as a whole instead of a single, popular track. although, after several years of being a fan of the eels, i'm confident in saying electro-shock blues is their best album anyway.

a friend of mine saw them perform in a bowling alley and he got me a signed copy of oh what a beautiful morning, their first live album, which is *great* (electro-shock blues show is also awesome). one of the best gifts i've ever received. 
i loved the one version used for the [hitman trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybt-9lhe8ms).
walkie-talkies?!?!?  is this 1984?  i am an old(ish) guy and i was thinking that many people will be on walkie-talkies-they will all be text messaging, twittering, and updating facebook.
ya, you know i was thinking about that after i posted... something doesn't quite add up.
i agree about the electro-shock blues show.  it's a great live album.  i just love how sarcastic the version of novocaine is.  i've been lucky enough to hear the new record and i was really glad to find that it's just as good as anything else e has ever done.  
it's actually how i discovered the band.  love all their work.  
i still think slowdive's version is better
i love the nc-17 allusions and the archetypal contrasts in this one.
one of my favourite bands, good to see some reddit appreciation for them. anyone with the slightest interest in e and quantum physics should definately check out the bbc4 doc about his dad, it's really quite marvellous. 

also, while we're on eels and the bbc, how good a use of an eels track as an intro tune was this?

that accounts for outkast... pharcyde would be a matter of opinion. i would have liked to see the arsonists on there.
a good number of these so-called back stories seem to consist of "they decided to name themselves *blank* just because" (see band of horses and interpol). when they offer what could actually be called an explanation (see the killers), they get the story wrong (it's a fictional band name, not a "fictional brand of bass-drum").

my understanding of artist management is that even if you fire a manager, they still continue earning a percentage of future income. kind of like alimony after a divorce. there is recognition for the work the manager put in to get you were you are. i could be wrong, but something still smells fishy about this allegation. 

yeah. i was flipping through the channels one night and stopped and thought, "hey, that looks like e!"... really interesting show
sorry, i gotta call bullshit on this one.  there just isn't a shred of proof.
i think that depends on the contract and the duration of the contract. i don't know how reliable this source is but it seems to line up with what i've read in books previously...

in general, you can use any standard 1/2"-mount cartridge on any 1/2"-mount headshell or tonearm, and any p-mount (aka t4p) cartridge on any p-mount tonearm. some cartridges are better suited to some tonearms than others, but they should all work and sound decent enough. 

if you just want to replace the stylus (aka needle) on your existing cartridge, you need to find the correct stylus for that cartridge. there is very little interchangability between different types of styli.

i could give you a better answer if you told me what brand and model of turntable you have, and what cartridge.
sweet! i'll bring the condoms.
hmm, the first and third one (particularly the first) are very much headache inducers, i can imagine the first one is used to torture people.

second one seems to keep wanting to break out into some music but won't get past the initial stage or is some sort of interlude.

i'd imagine people who like this would derive the most pleasure from seeing all three blended together, it seems to be that the chaos of it is a good thing.

i think i like the sound of rain at night because it has more to it than simply the sound of rain, for example i'm in my room going off to sleep, it's raining outside but my room is warm and dry, makes me feel more cozy. to that end i guess i can see how music can help set the mood when complimented with actual actions like in a music video or movie. having said that i find music videos to be completely nonsensical but that might be because it is tied to music itself.
i guess terrible is a harsh word, but certainly unoriginal is well-suited to most of them.

sucks to be us 
a lot of the post-punk stuff doesn't hold up over the years, but this band definitely does. all of their albums are great - especially script of the bridge. 
esqueeze me? the beatles were excellent musicians. i wouldn't even call the early stuff 'simplistic.' plus, ringo unfairly gets a lot of shit for his drumming. he may not be the best, but he was creative. 
i just can't wait to play the drums to tomorrow never knows on difficult.

on a powder day when the sky is blue, the eels are the best band to snowboard to.
as op, i agree however, when writing the title of this i'll be honest and admit, i wasn't putting as much elaborate thought as you might have put in to your reply. there isn't ever really a real or fake type of music when it comes down to it. maybe the right word i was looking for instead of "real" should have been different or more abstract? i don't really know. i don't intend on saying the quality of more popular music shown on pop culture icons such as mtv or vh1 play shitty music. as much as i hate it soulja boy is still making more money than i am. my intent when sharing this video was to share what i think is a different type of rap or hiphop that maybe other people will like.

you realise the basic definition of hip-hop is a rapper and a dj, so why wouldn't rappers are hip-hop artists?

sound quality is better hq on youtube
pretty neat, though the real good part of the mashup didn't really start until the last minute or so. the rest was one song at a time, with the samples looping in the background, which sort of defeats the point of a mashup (get as many voices in as possible to make something new and better than any of the parts)
didnt someone post this like 8 months ago. something about it being 4 chordsthat like 9 million hit songs used

this thread is about a classically trained vocalist.  you're bringing up a singer, nice as her voice may sound, from a completely different genre.  it doesn't really matter how nice a singer's personal vocal stylings may or may not be, they won't compare favorably to a classically trained vocalist.

i happen to agree, regina spektor is a good singer.  she's not a virtuoso, however.

in other words, janice joplin had soul, but mariah carey hits notes she couldn't have thought of hitting.
perfect example. i was just going to say, how fucking hard is it to put a million songs to a 4/4 beat.  it's always going to be inevitable to find one's that go with similar chords as well. 
this video is actually a great message to all the idiots around the world.
i read the same thing.  i was really confused.
brilliant.
it isn't really surprising.  entire genres of music are based on less.  the blues for example.  while technicality and lyricism could differentiate one artist from the next, i iv v still holds true.  

shit, even jazz the pretentious asshole of music has the ii v i progression.
i've always wondered where people get their hands on the original vocals for these songs. i'd love to get my hands on some.

the only time anyone ever uses the world "viral" it is from those attempting to fake one. 
very expertly done, although when you're dealing with just the vocal track over a lame chord progression like viva la vida, everything is going to work pretty well.

starlight, for example, wouldn't work at all with more than the vocal track. like most muse songs, it's a ton more complex than viva la vida.

and he is right.
wow.
i really don't care for too much new music, but this i like.
what normally breaks it for me is the singer. yours (or you) is (are) fantastic.
is there any other music?
what's the history of this band?
finally read the full article, and it is heartbreaking, mm was a really smart dude, shame whats going on.

i've had no interest in the new album , is it worth even bothering with?
yeah, mm really is smart and i love his earlier work but sometimes the creative candle just burns out quickly for some artists.  the problem is they don't know when to quit.
some of these aren't correct

i guess when i was reading this i was reading it as great"est" albums by the great"est" bands. but, i realize now that it is simply a list of great albums. in which case i agree with it. i am sure doesn't matter to you, but i felt the need to explain. :)

something more extreme, binka dobreva - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuufo3tt7a4&amp;fmt=22

i think the whole point of the satriani case is that the melody is exactly the same.  the four chord progression isn't copyrightable, but the tune is and satriani wrote "if i could fly" years before coldplay released viva la vida.  i'd be shocked if the judge doesn't find in the guitarist's favour.

no the new album is rubbish, this coming from a guy who used to be a huge fan. i have a lot of respect for the person manson used to be, he knew what he wanted and he did what he had to to get it... and got it. but now he's there it looks like the only route is back down the hill.

i don't think friendships in the band really help matters these days though, it wasn't only manson who made the band great.

it sounded terrible.
i agree. not exactly the music i listen to, but very well done. 

my only complaint is what i say about virtually all contemporary music--enough with the fucking auto-tune. i get it that that's the trend in vocals, but i think it sounds frickin' terrible. for me, it marks the single most significant difference between kid music and adult music.
i lived songbird however it just seemed a little to unstable. if i fast forwarded to a specific part of a song, there would be a delay. why can't i just make songbird my default media player?!
interestingly enough, we don't use auto-tune in that song. :-p go figure.

full disclosure: there is a little bit of manual pitch correction here and there (about 5 instances in this song) - mostly on long, sustained notes where it was noticeably off - but we make a point of not affecting the vocals other than eq, reverbs, delays, doubles, etc. we don't do straight auto-tuning.

it literally took 25 takes to get all the pieces right.

thank you for your feedback, by the way! we appreciate it. :-)
thanks so much!

dude this is frickin' great-almost as good as that new nickleback song!!
thanks for listening!
hasn't he always been.
wow, seriously?!! i have to listen again. could it be that the auto-tune sound has infiltrated *how people sing*? yikes.

ok, going to give it another listen.

hm. could what i'm hearing be doubling and a gate of some kind? no.... what's going on at 1:08 and 1:18 and 1:36 (there's a bit of it between those 2 points)

ok. i must have been hearing the manual corrections, because you're right, there are only a handful of places.

in that case, you have a fucking phenomenal vocalist. i liked the song more on the second listen. reminded me a bit of classic rush. next listen will be on my carver &amp; snells instead of crappy computer speakers.

so... more critique--the loud parts get a bit crowded. leave a little more room in there. everyone loves amplitude, but if the 1970's taught us anything, it's that coke and ecsta--no, wait-- it's that dynamic range is awesome.

but really good. i'm going to go read more about your band now... thanks for posting!
he always seemed pretentious to me.  when his mainstream breakout was just a cover of an 80s song...
i got pit tickets for mayhem this year and i'm much more excited to see slayer than mm.  
blank stare
that comment sucked. this isn't the music i typically listen to, but that was a pointlessly shitty thing to say.
predates satriani:

thank you for listening. i love when i can get some well-trained and well-adjusted ears on our stuff. any and all feedback in the future would be greatly appreciated.
my ears are well-trained, but very poorly adjusted. like the rest of me.
very cool, but also very difficult to listen to
what? he didn't just twitter about it this time?
&gt; no the new album is rubbish, this coming from a guy who used to be a huge fan. i have a lot of respect for the person manson used to be, he knew what he wanted and he did what he had to to get it... and got it. but now he's there it looks like the only route is back down the hill.

same.  i have old manson stuff on my rotation every day, but the new shit is garbage.
i hope jeordie gets away for good from marilyn. his band goon moon is great and fresh sounding; unlike marilyn who is just a broken record at this point.

i still contend that the nail in the coffin between marilyn and reznor was manson's book where he detailed a night where they both picked up a hooker with a yeast infection and instead of gang banging her they basically just molested her.
/me thinks the ads for manson's new album aren't strategically placed.
they also change the key so that they match with the chords.
i'm right with you there on that my friend.
trent reznor can go eat shoes.
???

ծ_ծ

???
the obvious comment has too be made, "when hasn't he been?"
look, reznor's good.  but he's just seriously biased against manson.  

the new album, just like every album he's ever done, is good.

manson's evolved a bit.  his syntax is great, the music is really nice.  

are his first three albums my favorites?  yes.  but, the others are excellent as well.
...like reznor after the downward spiral?
i'm not a green day fan (or hater), but consider american idiot a guilty pleasure.  with formidable years in the 70s, i'm a sucker for concept albums.  i was amused to see my 2 favorite tracks on the album, whatshername and letterbomb, make that list.
exactly.
thanks 1997.
the fragile had some good stuff... some.
trent reznor is very good at picking fault with other people and curiously blind to the fact his music is as generic and bland as britney spears played through a glorified fuzz box.
good god.
i have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
the nightwatchman is god!
&gt;but trent is engaged to filipina

&gt;if you get the jap import of the new cd

what the hell, dude
really? that doesn't sound very trent-ish
pot. kettle. black.
yes! we've arrived! thanks!
i just picked up tickets myself, and am bringing my girlfriend because she has never seen manson before and i told her he puts on a great show. i hope that is the case still. either way, at least i will get to see slayer. =)
i do cocaaaaaaaine
didn't he choose to go back? 

the problem with manson is he always wanted to be a rock superstar, well he got there and now he doesn't know what to do.
you do realize "jap" is a derogatory term? it's the equivalent of "spic" or "kike." 
try using it in polite company - at work, in church, or in front of your parents. better yet, say it in front of some asians. let us know how that goes. 
coming from trent, that really means something.  
but good! i really enjoy your stuff.
i suppose that's okay. 

well, good talking to you. i gotta go hang out with my best friend tony, who is black. he's the nicest nigger i've ever met. 
nin has had some misses, but both year zero and the slip have great tracks.  and all of ghosts i-iv is good instrumental if you like electronic music.
as far as i'm concerned...he started sucking with mechanical animals...

but in fairness, there were 2 decent songs on there (great big white world and last day on earth)...decent in the sense that they blew on that album, but are amazing on acoustic (see last tour on earth)...

at the same rate, (imo) reznor became pretty generic after the fragile...
become?
i only like crap music. will i still like it?
i for one think this is awesome.
i am going to downmod you and i will do something most do not..i will explain my reasons.

the fact that your wife is asian is irrelevant.  also since asian is such a broad term and encompass many nationalities its hard to tell where you could be coming from.  ask an individual from korea or china what they think of the japanese, not a lot love between those nations due to wwii. ask someone from taiwan what they think of the mainland chinese. etc etc. 

being married to an individual of another race does not suddenly give a free pass to toss around derogatory terms context or not. its like being married to a black person and claiming its ok to toss around 'nigger' since you somehow inherit the right to use the racially sensitive terms via marriage. derogatory is derogatory. 

in the west (i am assuming you are american? please correct me if i am wrong) the term jap has been used in a derogatory way for countless years especially in war inspired movies. ie: 'those damn japs.'   

marilyn manson still makes albums and people listen to them?  who knew?
well as long as the intent is to identify and not insult.
trent is just pissed that such a big media stirrer left the everything label and now only trent and some rapper are on it. trent's new album sucks too, he must be needing to blame somebody.
her brain is just working way too fast for her to form the words that make sense haha.
    drugs and alcohol now rule [manson's] life
hahah! does trent even know manson? that has always been his thing. he even has an alcohol label.
you're welcome,

internet
didnt mm fail miserably at trying to pick up lady gaga
1. toughen up! your harshest critics can be your best asset. 

2. that said, what's to be cruel about? these are swell! i like that multitracked vocal sound. bringing the vox further up in the mix might be nice, but that depends on what you're going for. 
if by "some" you mean it's excellent front to back... then i agree.

with teeth was bad, but the last two have been pretty ok.
he always was a clown. clowns are scary. now he's not a clown anymore, he's just a dope.
if you're referring to nothing records, marilyn manson never left it. nothing was a division of interscope that dissolved after some legal disputes. i'm not sure which rapper you're thinking of, but i don't think nothing ever had any rap or hip hop on it. as for trent, he's not on any label at all now. he let his contract expire and has released his last two albums independently. 

and i respectfully disagree about the new album. to each their own, but hey, he did release it for free.  
oh fuck, right off.  jap is nothing like nigger.  you little pc faggots go out of your way to take offense to shit just so you can fuel the self-righteous indignation that is the only thing sustaining your pathetic, miserable lives.
&gt;you little pc faggots

lol. says the guy who would never in a million years have the balls to say "jap" in front of a japanese person or "spic" in front of hispanic people...or "faggot" in front of someone who is gay. you're trying way too hard and making it much too easy for us non-ignorami. 

to everyone downmodding me: you're all cowards too. say one of these slurs to someone's face for a change, and report back here. those words aren't so tame, are they? 
in fairness, trent reznor admit his problems, cleaned up his life and has been sober for years. this article takes his quotes from the mojo article out of context a little. basically, trent talks about how drugs ruined his life and his art, and he went to rehab to really turn his life around. then he talks about manson and basically says, "he was a good friend, we had a falling out. it was both our faults. now he's letting drugs ruin him the way the ruined me. i hope he can get the help he needs." 
as someone who has bought alot of foreign cds/dvds/etc, i've seen the terms 'jp' and 'jap' in used the context of labeling media-related merchandise many times, so this usage was not odd to me at all given that you were talking about a foreign release of an album.  

i can see how it would cause confusion to others though.
that was so unimpressive.

marty friedman's symphony of destrucion is so much better.
trent was a very different person in the early 90's from his mature self of today. manson and him did mountains of cocaine together. they stopped talking around the time manson's [tell-all book](http://www.amazon.com/long-hard-road-out-hell/dp/0060987464/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244058491&amp;sr=8-1) came out in 1999. manson also disclosed the short and dysfunctional love affair between reznor and courtney love. manson and trent reconciled after the fragile came out. manson appeared in the video for startfuckers to say to the world "trent and i made up and are friends again". [in the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqs88ocyzni#t=2m37s) there is a fat chick in an amusement park dunk tank that's suppose to represent courtney. trent throws a baseball and dunks the guy and chears along with marilyn. the message being: courtney is a "starfucker".
he's taking it back.
yeah, he left for a few years and went back; so now i'm hoping after this recent album he leaves for good.
they know eachother quite well, reznor is to manson as dr. dre is to eminem.  portrait of an american family was even recorded in trents house [which happened to be sharon tate's house, who was famously murdered there by the manson family..]
he's not saying he is going to go around sling racial slurs at every one around, he simply said that the aforementioned "pc faggots" 'take offense to shit just [to] fuel [their] self-righteous indignation...'



we're not supposed to be able to do a lot of things, we do them anyway.
but its shit for the other 90% of us
do not like, sorry man. same old same old...

wish ya the best of luck though!
...didn't dave mustaine write symphony of destruction?
no problem here! we don't expect everyone to like it and aren't offended when someone doesn't. thanks for the wishes!
i dont think glitterlok realized that...try googling "the worst band ever"
no one's taking offense to anything, unless you count the people who gratuitously use slurs and then try to defend themselves and the weight of their words. it's a racial slur, not a batting average. 

satx is trying to compare one slur to the other, when they are both equally disgusting, harmful words. that's why i said he doesn't have the balls to say them in public - he knows he would get his ass kicked in either case. i can't believe i actually had to explain that.
&gt;look, reznor's good. but he's just seriously biased against manson.

&gt;the new album, just like every album he's ever done, is good.

sounds to me like you're seriously biased towards manson.

...and that still doesn't explain the shoe eating comment.

*edit: markdown*
with teeth is excellent imo. i love alot of the tracks on that album. not as good as year zero, which is outstanding.
fragile is still my favourite however.
[proof.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8077246.stm)
what is trent reznor's deal with calling people out these days?  who does he think he is, wayne coyne?.  i lose respect for artists that rag on other artists.  i'm not a huge nin fan, learned most of what i know about them when trent stole justin meldal-johnsen (favorite bassist) from beck, but from a distance trent seems like a, well, a jerk, and stuff like this and the prince thing confirm that.
protip: try googling "sarcasm" ;-)

nothing burns an insulter like making it seem you didn't notice.
this stars my old art teacher as the milkman. it's a small world...

enjoy! 
ron paul? :p
i'm sure you've taken a survey.  way to pull numbers out of your ass!
it is much easier to just be insulted by something, rather than trying to understand context.   from the frequency with which it occurs, i must assume it is more fun too.
i think it is pretty ignorant to generalize the term "jap" to all asians as you continue to do.  there is a lot of racial hatred between the chinese and japanese, so it isn't hard to see that a chinese person might get a kick out of that if they bought into racism.  or are all asians the same in your world?
my favorite bit of slick rick guest work:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_jggz35w5s
&gt;or are all asians the same in your world?

excuse me; i meant to say "would never in a million years have the balls to say "jap" in front of a japanese person." 

apparently it applies to you too. 
breaking news:  trent reznor takes axel rose's crown as biggest shit talker in rock n roll.
that's a really bad name for any song, let alone title track.
that baby crying effect is used in an asian pop group called 5566 and a new dj alligator song called calling you. 
&gt;&gt; from his mature self of today.

have you ever listened to this guy's lyrics?
cannot upvote enough.
yeeeah. relatively speaking.
he's normally pretty soft-spoken about other artists except to praise them, in my experience. 

these two recent outbursts you cite really seem to be exceptions to the norm.
so trent has issues with universal music group and interscope records...and then trashes chris cornell and marilyn manson, who are with interscope. 

nothing more to see here.
his wordplay is getting worse and worse as it wears on. his new album's lyrics are downright sad in some areas...

he's never been a great musician, but he had a vitality and charisma that carried him, along with good producers. he's lost that vitality, and hasn't really had a good producer since ma. with both gone, he just kinda spins aimlessly frothing off at anything that walks by. 
cocaine is a helluva drug.
seconded. i was a huge fan during acss and ma. i thought holywood was okay, buy filled with too much fluff. i though gog was pretty bad. i thought em, dm was terrible. this, ultimately, is no better. it's meandering, pseudo-artistic wankery at its best, and unlistenable, bad "fashionable" rock at its worst. 
become?
if 10% of the population liked it, that would be pretty amazing.
a++ would upvote again
source of the most bizarre tech conference keynote ever at last year's javaone.
i don't think so. the fragile was pretty good - lots of filler, but some really strong tracks as well (the way out is through, the fragile, into the void, the big comedown, underneath it all...). with teeth was pretty bad, but i enjoy year zero just as much as tds, and at the very least its sonically different and vital sounding compared to the rest of the popular music landscape. there's also plenty of neat stuff on the slip and ghosts. 

nine inch nails is one of the few bands i enjoy from the early nineties that i still find entertaining. 
hmm interesting.. reddit is turning into a gossip magazine.
never heard of it
prince thing?
let me reiterate what i wrote up there.

in western society (specifically the "america's" using the term jap is considered offensive by many people. it can be considered a derogatory term in reference to japanese people.

i also stated the 'my wife/husband/partner/relation' comment never justifies use of a slur, regardless of context. it is a weak defense.

your intention may not have been to use it in a derogatory way (clearly it was not said in a spiteful or hateful way) however you clearly stated you were not aware of its derogatory nature. we simply pointed it out to you why and how it is considered a slur. 

by the way, the country code for japan is jp (iso 3166-1.) not jap. its unfortunate its mislabeled by amazon and other import companies.  

so please, my logic is not flawed, i was simply stating facts and pointed out how your logic was flawed with a free card based off martial status to an asian and your self professed ignorance when it came to the term.
you might be thinking of "gook"?
i wonder what would happen if they were both owned by the same company. it would probably be a non-issue.
&gt;'those damn japs.'

so if they said "those damn japanese" then you would consider 'japanese' to be a racial slur?!?!

is "those damn mines" a racial slur on landmines? i guess europeans are pretty offended that their currency is called the "euro".

bitch.
thought i'd bring some akerfeldt to lighten up your day.  also some b-movie cornfieldesque movie clips.
knowing when to quit/do something else/reinvent yourself must be incredibly difficult for a rock star, especially when you see some of your contemporaries still putting out exciting things and filling huge concert halls...

at least he's rotting past his expiration date with the same flamboyant, degenerate style that pretty much made his career happen. tons of drugs, babbling lurid nonsense and making interviewers feel uneasy...contrast that with billy corgan's pissyfit a while back when his own fans booed him after he wanked his experimental noise thing all over them for 40 minutes.
i have never thought i'd favor book burning. in this case, i make an exception. only thing is, you'd have to actually buy the book first. 
i think they're both on sony bmg
in other news, marilyn manson and chris cornell are starting a band called soundmansonslave
coldplay is on capital.
i like it. it has a very nice melody and just seems to flow nicely. only complaint i would have would just be on the mixing (i feel like the bass/deeper tones aren't really there). but i think that's just personal preference... otherwise, good show! 
well, trent reznor used to make good music, a long time ago.

countdown with keith olbermann
same here, on bass. i spend way too much time tweaking the eq on my bass and amp trying to get a decent sound, then whenever i bite the bullet and just change the strings everything falls into place.
oh bliss! bliss and heaven! oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh. it was like a bird of rarest-spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now. as i slooshied, i knew such lovely pictures!
what made windows choose this
do you have a link to the billy corgan thing?

edit: [i guess its this](http://www.clashmusic.com/news/billy-corgan-talks-new-material)

&gt; smashing pumpkins caused controversy on a tour of the united states last year by playing formless noise 'jams' instead of their much loved back catalogue. enduring boos and cat-calls from fans, some onlookers even walked out rather than be subjected to yet more noise.
in part 2, at 6:34 there's what looks like a silver "58" on the floor... what mic is that and can anyone give an educated guess as to what the placement is supposed to capture? im so very intrigued....
bravo.
maybe he should make a song about it? 
the only thing i can guess is that since cardioid mics have a proximity effect, meaning that they capture much more bass when placed closer than like 4" to the source, so since it's on the floor, he may be trying to get some of the floor resonance to mix in, while still getting some bright tones (as it's placed on the tile part which would reflect these. definitely unconventional
i was thinking he was referring to adore, machina and to a lesser extent, the future embrace. (if you were, fuck you, those were great albums in their own right.)

what i don't understand about some pumpkins fans (relating to the second link) is how they some how act surprised when billy and the gang pulls something like this. we're talking about a band that did a 22 minute version of over the rainbow, a portion of which was james iha holding a toy gun that went 'pew pew' up to his guitar for a fair bit because it sounded good. silverfuck, the usual show closer, is bare minimum 6 minutes longer then it should be and most of that is just billy dicking around on the mic during the quiet portion, or a wall of distorted guitars at the end.

anyways, it's sad to see manson go to the shit house. his music has never been amazing but he had his own thing going and it was fun to listen too. he also came off really intelligent in all the interviews he did. i remember he had an incredibly insightful discussion with micheal moore in 'bowling for columbine' 
i went to it in 1992.

probably not the same.

edit: that having been said, it was the second best concert i've ever been to.
you guys are great!! i like the drummer's groove. and the arrangements are cool.
here's my new project:
http://thejourneymen.net
hometown favorite that just f'ing rock. also a must see vid http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eywkkujr5y
smashing pumpkins could produce quality when they wanted, and did.  the best marilyn manson song doesn't hold a candle to it.

psychosis can come to any musician, however.  as such, i think there is probably good reason why certain members of smashing pumpkins refuse to reform.  i highly doubt any of the original energy could be recaptured.
i don't understand your reference to wayne coyne.  has he been outspoken against other artists specifically?  or has he just voiced distaste at current music in general?

given the material wayne coyne has helped produce, i wouldn't take his opinion lightly.
i've always been a fan of chris cornell, and that recent abortion with timberland leaves me speechless...
i know, shoes are fucking awesome!
i can't hear this without thinking about windows xp sample music.

a great piece nonetheless.
details at some level indicate intent and motivation.

for instance: the term "americano" could be considered a derogatory term in spanish for an american person.  cry me a river.

edit: i fully support iso standards, and seriously everyone, get on board with following open standards such as this, if you don't want to be paying increasing corporate taxes for the rest of your life.
the piece is much longer than this.  and it's excellent the whole way through, particularly the final movement.
white denim? i prefer pissed jeans.
you guys look tasty.

t-rex
meh, i'm more interested in the pen cam used to create that awesome video. also, what version of windows movie maker?
he was talking about how prince claims to have all these amazing unreleased songs but his albums have sucked.
it was in the digg interview.
the story i have on that is that he was pissed off with one of the guys doing the filming, and so refused to move.
really though, would you say that either one was uncalled for?
um...no.

fuck trent reznor. manson is a tremendously talented artist, and he still produces interesting and enjoyable material after many years.
wait, you're telling me you actually like chris cornell and marilyn manson? 

wake up sheeple cferro obviously works for interscope.
i think he might have said so about the singer from jane's addiction. i'm not for sure if it's him, but i remember he said something like "those guys just aren't good people."
up for a bit of the old ultra-violence, are we?
i think at that level it's like bottling lightning... you come up with a sound that helped a generation define themselves, how long can you keep doing it? like rolling a 20 (but infinitely harder). now roll it again. again. how long can you keep it up?

and drugs probably fucked them all up. the pace of that lifestyle is so excessive, the highs are so extremely high, it's not really a surprise they keep trying to recapture it chemically. whatever they were hungry for, success or fame, they already have it.
it's inspiring to see random mic placements like that. im new to the school of recording but random things like that are the things that keep me cooking.
i wasn't expecting that. thank you.
heh, sort of. the "incident" i am referring to [happens in this video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nlwrerd8ii&amp;feature=related).

when it happened, it caused a minor controversy (and gave a bunch of redditors an excuse to reminisce about the old albums, the old pumpkins, and how much they rocked). the gays obviously got miffed a bit, but the majority of people just found the "retort" immature and distasteful, especially for such a respected and sensitive veteran of rock. what ultimately came out of the incident is a debate about the relationship of a rock band with its fans.

a lot of people agreed with the heckler and thought he should get his money back - after all, doesn't a band have responsibilities towards its paying fans (i.e. why don't you play the hits we all love and came to hear)? a lot of people thought corgan was in the right (except for the retort), and that no fan has the right to demand that corgan sacrifice his artistic freedom - the artist's responsibility is only to his vision, and if you don't like it, don't go to the concert (i.e. if you came with your ears open only to the radio hits, then you should've bought a ticket to see a pumpkins cover band). 

in the end, though, most agreed the noise jams were kind of wanky and corgan himself was a wanker for, at the very least, failing to think up a better comeback line.
or maybe a little in-out, in-out?
i dont know. the video [from a different angle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riyac1bhdza&amp;feature=related) really looks staged. ill always love the original pumpkins, but all their new shit is trash. how much more uninspired can 'american gothic' sound? at least we still have 'pisces iscariot'.
outkast as portrayed by sweaty white dudes.
christ, i am surprised they lasted as long as they did! corgan's been [notoriously difficult to work with from the start](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siamese_dream#background) and his bandmates were kind of fucked too (i'm looking at you, chamberlain). 

nah, the wild and explosive energy corgan harnessed in the 90s took too tremendous a toll on him (and his bandmates) - it's not something he can do ever again, with or without them. the whole thing is kind of sad, really. [remember this, for example?](http://www.mtv.com/shared/promoimages/bands/c/corgan_billy/billy_corgan_pumpkins_reunite/corgan_chi_times_ad.jpg)
i recall members of led zeppelin saying something to the effect of, "we do all those drugs to calm ourselves down from the high of performing onstage."
i wouldn't be surprised in the least. it seems like corgan's throwing a hissyfit on a much grander scale (see [this](http://stereogum.com/archives/mr-corgan-goes-to-washington_057782.html), [this](http://www.prefixmag.com/news/billy-corgan-finds-new-ways-to-sell-his-soul-to-th/25522/), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0xrti64yky&amp;eurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hitsville.org%2f2009%2f03%2f07%2fsellout-watch%25e2%2580%2594billy-corgan%2f&amp;feature=player_embedded), and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryycyt8fplg)) - maybe the staged confrontation's a part of it, or maybe it was the catalyst for his recent spree of corporate toolery.
rawr
thanks sprats. you just shit all over my childhood. :)
i want to make some music. i have several instruments and can play them fairly well. i would like to record the music i play on them on my computer and would like to know what software is the best for doing this. i want something that is simple and easy to use.

i have tried fl studio, but it is way to complicated for me to use. i run windows xp. any ideas what would be the best thing to do?
no way. his lyrics are very mature. what they are *not* is commonly accepted, but that has no connection with maturity. if anything, i consider him much more mature than the majority of musicians. he is not confused, maybe a pained human being, but very understanding.
young me liked "five" best.

as i grew, i changed my tune...

could listen all day.
you might want to submit here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/wearethemusicmakers/

oh man do i feel that too...those guys were the first band i was a legitimate fan of. before my parents bought me siamese dream, i'd stay up and call the alterna-rock station late at night with requests for cherub rock. i definitely gave the djs a few wtf moments - it's 3 in the morning, and someone who sounds like they're 8 (with a foreign accent, no less!) timorously calls up...

the infinite sadness tour was also my first concert, and a huge web archive of live tracks was the first time mp3s and i met.

i tried to revisit all that stuff recently - that maybe-staged argument with the fan spurned me to give everything up till mellon collie a listen. i *couldn't stand* mc&amp;tis, which came as a total surprise to me, considering that was my favorite album for a year or two. pisces remained intact, more or less. siamese dream wasn't the same either, especially not after i read that most of the lyrics were about corgan's insecurities and girlfriend problems - the only thing i found myself hooked to were silverfuck and geek usa because of their sheer ferocity (i don't remember liking silverfuck *at all* when i was a kid). i ended up liking gish the best, and even then, i'd only listen to the heavy tracks. i think what it ultimately came down to is that heavy-as-fuck guitar sound - and chamberlain's drumming, of course. i can marvel at that no matter how many stupid commercials corgan spreads his asshole for.
wayne coyne is famous for going out of his way to repeatedly "dis, as the media says" other artists namely beck and the arcade fire.  the flaming lips toured with beck in 2002, and wayne seemed to do everything he could to make beck miserable (he ensured he "encored" after beck did every show for example).  he told defamatory stories about beck in interviews for months and months after.  more recently, he showed up on online taking a few low swipes are the arcade fire for no apparent reason.

would have gone to bonnaroo, but hit up sasquatch instead which had an almost identical lineup. 
henry rollins sums all this up. [slayer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvi5_8yidqm)
eminem, if he accepts, will eat him alive. eminem, in the art of rap battling, is un-defeat-able. this will be proven once more if this actually happens. 
personally, i was quite skeptical in listening to it at first, but it grew on me really quickly. it's really honest, his flow re-defines the definition of flow, and i like the themes a lot. opinions? 
cool. thanks dude.
don't like it as much as his older albums.
seems ok so far, i think hes in a transitional period. he's keeping true to the beat but not his alterego. also, i hate when he sings a chorus.
as much as it's a corny saying, i've found that honesty really is the best policy. just tell them straight out. if you want to be diplomatic though, just say that you preferred their old sound and they should stick to that. however, if theyre past that and want to keep doing what they're doing, just tell them you don't like it and if they're mature, they won't make a big deal out of it.
what's weird is, i read articles that talk about how he's 'staying true to his alter ego', but to me it's not like that at all either. if anything, it's a meshing of his alter ego and his real self. 

totally get that chorus-hating, though. notice how the best songs are the ones that have a sampled chorus?
understood, why though?
"you suck."
i really enjoy listening to this album. his lyrics, and the structure of his wording amazing. each verse is part of a very vivid story. 

i also really dig dre's verses in old time's sake. it's probably my favorite track.

dre's beats are inspiring, too. i just want to listen to the album to deconstruct them. 

my least favorite track: crack a bottle
beware the fruitcake spray!
-dromiceiomimus
k-k-k-k-k-k-k-kyeaaahhh!!!!
that's spectacular. it truly is. 
the album really grew on me. i was really dissappointed by we made you, but the later singles were much better. i was expecting something much more serious, proof's death wasn't really addressed (other than through drug use), but i was glad that he stayed true to "classic" eminem. whereas some criticize the fact he hasn't changed (mommy issues, drug problems, cartoon violence, hello = my name is, etc...) i see this as a good thing, and i felt hello was the best track on the album.
i'd rather he revert to "classic" eminem, than pick start auto tuning every syllable that came out of his mouth. 
personally i don't think it's possible for him to get better than his marshall mathers lp, slim shady lp, and the eminem show. but i do think this album was better than encore.
"you suck. you had sweet 'the roots' live hip-hop vibe, then decided to suck. bad."
nothing more to hear here either. he trashes them because cc and mm both suck.
where was there auto-tuning?
i think that it's further proof that people looking for actual hip-hop talent and lyrical substance should seek out hip-hop artists like eyedea, sage francis, the grouch, etc.

really. i mean. this is the guy whose "pee-pee" goes "duh-doing-doing-doing". give me a break. have some self-respect and some taste. dig deeper into the art and stop consuming the empty pointless nonsense from the hands that feed.
who?
[poof?](http://www.ennex.com/~pooff/image/poof.gif)
rectal prolapse more like.
that's the point, there wasn't. maybe revert wasn't the right choice of word. i said it because the eminem show wasn't that great of an album. 
"gawdamit! i just beat the wind tunnel on battletoads... **like hell** i'm moving"
i hate hip hop and rap. (that seems like a good start for a -15 post)

but, i respect eminem the same way i have nothing against the beastie boys and some other artists. they are fun, articulate and smart, not every song is about how many hoes he banged, money he got and gangstas he shot.

with that in mind, i will listen to this album later, and listen to [stan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ouzrqogrs) right now.


obligatory quote: "50 cent got more shots in the face than jenna jameson" - chris rock
when has he ever been anything other than a dopey clown?
the christopher reeves part made me laugh.
he was the only interviewee that didn't seem wacky and sounded quite intelligent in 'bowling for columbine'.


reminds me of a documentary about some crazies talking about triggering the second coming by cloning jesus. raël (french "aliens chose me" guru and pro-cloning militant) said something in the lines like "it doesn't make sense, it's just blood, cloning it would just give you a guy with the same features but he could be raised buddhist for all it cares". 
except trent reznor actually helped mm make it big by producing and distributing their music.
link them to this page.
it's pretty average, but the 'ass like that' voice he keeps doing makes me want to start pulling my hair out.
the album is ok but he isn't. did anyone see him on kimmel the other night? he couldn't even lip synch correctly and he looks old and too thin. 
&gt; in the end, though, most agreed the noise jams were kind of wanky and corgan himself was a wanker for, at the very least, failing to think up a better comeback line.

again, this is what i fail to understand about modern day pumpkins fans. this has always been the case, the case with even with the original band, more so infact. go watch some live footage of their lollapalooza stuff (this was back in 93) and enjoy the wankery.
have you ever heard a complete symphony orchestra up close in full flight? awesome in the extreme!
oh. i liked it, but perhaps i overappreciate it because it's the first eminem album i heard. out of curiosity, what was your favourite track on relapse?
i hope your not talking about the the velvet trench vibes

http://www.myspace.com/itsthevibes

because that would mean your taste in music sucks
yeah, ok, phoenix is pretty great, i have all their cds.  but the author of this piece lost my interest when he referred to their first lp as "untitled" (it's "united").  meh.
wasn't there some other musician dude with the name wolfgang amadeus?
eminem is not articulate or smart... all he does is make fun of celebrities now.  anybody can do that.  there's no subtance to his lyrics anymore.  although that's mainly because he kept getting sued from his older shit, so he had to tone it down.  and if you listen to the beastie boys, you will find a very methodical pattern to their lyrical approach.  one person sings most of a line, and then they all yell the last word.
if by awesome, you mean interminably cheesy.
is that the one where mozart gets the phoenix force?  that was an awesome issue.
eminem show sucked, slim shady lp was awesome and marshall mathers lp was pretty good.
yeah, what the fuck is with this desecration of mozart's name, the article never makes any mention of how this album in any way relates to mozart.
omg, somebody on reddit listening to actual hip hop? nice!

fyi, have you heard cunninlynguists' new album "strange journeys vol 1"?  it's the best album of the year by far.
you make me want to create a million new accounts to keep upvoting this.
[i really like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqbynwxgdm)
1901 is a great song
yeh, have you been wrong about bands you've disliked that became successful? as long as they're being true to themselves in their music, they may be hitting a vibe you just don't get, or like a lot less. let them know you don't like it as much, but really, it's their music.
i never heard of the guy, but the article says that he started his band at the same time as slayer and others in '83, but didn't start listening to classical until a couple of years later in '85-6.  
you've got bands like venom who started out before then.


i'll start....sorta lame song, but makes me sad...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ls1icwr4k
tell them they need a horn section, bad.
i've really been digging the new album.  it reminds me of soundsystem and a little bit of transistor.
he was familiar with classical music before that time.

he never heard venom.

venom also failed to invent much of what he did, which is why so much came of bathory and little sounds like venom.
superman's song, crash test dummies.
"latter days" by over the rhine
i'd put "snow angels" by over the rhine up there as well...
guess i'll need to check out some bathory.
it's a matter of perception. back in the day, he could get away with screaming into his delay pedal for 10 minutes in the middle of silverfuck 'cause the original pumpkins were excellent on stage together and the fans would readily forgive their indulgences. hell, everyone loved it - reverby, echoy stuff always sounds better in a huge arena with thousands of other screaming fans around you.

looking back on it, those noise bits from the old live shows are hit or miss at best. the original band's no more, corgan's been putting out penguin shit for the past decade, and with so much choice available nowadays, folks are more discriminating about noise, drone, art rock, psychedelia, and music in general. i'm sure there's a die-hard corgaphile or two who enjoyed the wankery in question (now and then), but most fans (what's left of them anyway) came back to hear the old songs. it's not a huge arena in 1993 with thousands of young, screaming fans waiting to hear this new awesome thing. it's the second half of the lunatic decade that followed, the show's in some mid-sized nyc venue where a wallet gets date raped every time someone orders a beer, and a bunch of people too hip for their own good are waiting to see an aging rocker (hopefully) play all the cool songs he wrote over a decade ago. the evening's money better be well-spent, or else the internet will hear about it.  
last night i went into the studio with a pop producer and he recorded one of the songs i had been playing with my band for a while.  i let him do his own thing and at the end i really liked what he came up with, but when i played it for my roommate(who's in the band) and my girlfriend they both really didn't like the newer version.  

i took their criticism well largely because i didn't write the new parts, i may have been slightly more offended had i taken the time to write them and record them myself like i usually do...so maybe you should tell them, but tell them what you don't like about it rather than just saying "your new sound sucks".
i recommend it because it's good music and, if you like slayer or other powerful metal, i think you'll dig it. recommended albums: *the return*,*blood, fire, death* and *hammerheart*.

excellent, thanks.  i've been getting into bands like nile, death, cynic, atheist, etc. more recently, so it'll definitely be worth checking them out. 
almost all metal guitar players learn some classical. 

there is even neo-classical metal genre. guitar players have been electrifying classical music for decades even some of the glam rock bands.
are all these guys swedish?

"rain" by cunninlynguists

"wise up" - aimee mann
interesting. i find "rain song" to be really uplifting.

nin/j cash - hurt

gary jules - mad world

fiona apple - never is a promise
the beatles' "she's leaving home" is sad and happy at the same time.
johnny cash's version of "hurt"

such a sad song, her voice makes me shiver every single time that i hear it...
point taken, thanks.
you're thinking of falco
tears in heaven - eric clapton...he wrote it about his son who died after he fell out a window when he was 5.  it was sad just typing that.
i think thats a silver mt zion song, isn't it?
soup- blind melon
i rather enjoyed that film.
ben folds - "brick"

the smiths (or maybe just morrissey?) - last night i dreamt somebody loved me
cool choices. for technical metal, i can also recommend [gorguts](http://www.anus.com/metal/gorguts) and [obliveon](http://www.anus.com/metal/obliveon). samples of legal length on the site.

for deathgrind and percussive death metal like nile, well, you've probably heard suffocation and infester.
granted, he admitted that he's brand new to the band. 

i also didn't quite follow his implication that long-time phoenix fans are european. i'm american and i've been in love with the guys since i heard "if i ever feel better." meh.

nah, i don't like them. i just think the scenario described above is plausible. nor do i work for interscope.
aphex twin - kesson daslef

i like a song the chinese name of which i don't know. i think it's *"yu ge."* it's sometimes called "fisherman's night song" or "evening fisher's song" or similar. 

[here's a *zheng* soloist doing it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ima5hfwklxa) and [here's another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcl-qnbp1iu).

there are lots of other things calling themselves some variation of "fisherman's song," like 
[this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdhsoaxjr8i) or [this pretty erhu/zheng duet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9chj4gib0-s) or [this big orchestral thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3u7k_bdfrq), but they're not the same song. 


"in the aeroplane over the sea" - neutral milk hotel

i was kinda kidding, but seriously, it doesn't take a conspiracy to trash chris cornell and marilyn manson. cornell hasn't put out anything exciting since soundgarden and marilyn manson...well even if you -were- a fan, he clearly needs help.
more or less, i just don't understand why trent reznor makes a fuss every few weeks or so, using social media. it would be one thing if cc or mm trashed him first, but he just looks overly butthurt about nothing that concerns him.
didn't expect that to be posted, but i can see it.  for bm, i'd go soul one first, though.
*raining in baltimore* - counting crows
k'naan is one of my favorite artists and i didn't think many people had heard of him.  i saw this at number 48 - hells to the yes.
and in doing so, comes off more whiny than ever. it's hard to take big bad trent seriously when he's bawwwwing over marilyn manson.

yea i can see that. i used to marvel at the guitar at the end of "hummer" but when i reheard it recently i didnt feel anything. damn i havent listen to gish in forever! i have to dig that up. songs on mc+is that i ignored as a kid stand out now like "porcelina" and "ruby". "xyu" is still killer. honestly, the saddest thing about the pumpkins is that they broke up just as they discovered the sounds used on machina and on the songs "real love" "dross" and "lucky 13". fucking incredible. and then what? zwan? life fucking sucks that way.

you may find the lists [here](http://www.barbelith.com/topic/23889) and [here](http://www.barbelith.com/topic/9797) have good leads.

old modest mouse, eels, and what other people have posted.

big difference is mv lip synched to someone else's voices and they won a grammy for their recording. if mv actually sang on the recording and lip synched live, i don't think the people would have cared then either.
agreed. the video was pretty great. 
if autotune was as developed/prevalent then as it is now, they likely could have done their own vocals.  so, yeah, i'm for downplaying some of the shame and scorn they received, given the crap that passes for music nowadays.
the album is only 8 dollars on itunes. i purchased the shit out of it. 
the saddest song i've heard recently is "lose you" by pete yorn, though admittedly this is as much due to it being associated with house s05e20: simple explanation as much as anything else.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyuxlzkwxls

for some reason; freebird.
so, in the same breath, the author can dismiss jazz as "pompous," then dump on every other genre of music except metal and classical? that's a shame because the classical choices are quite nice.

by far the saddest (in the 'fucked up' sense) - ['dance with the devil'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m72zvubnpea) by immortal technique.  the guy kidnaps, assaults, rapes and murders a random person in order to get into a gang, and when he removes the mask, realizes its his own mother...fucked up shit.  good song though.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qen3xovtfc
this looks like the kind of article i might really enjoy had i heard any of the main proponents of the music under scrutiny, like zomby, starkey etc.  as it is, knowing only burial (not really wonky?) and flying lotus (epically underwhelming imo), i skimmed it and i'm left thinking "christ, since when is _not quantising_ worthy of all this wankery, it's only what 'real' musicians have been doing _since forever_".  thanks for posting it, maybe if i get a chance i'll check the youtubes and form a more considered opinion.  

edit: checked "kaliko" which apparently "draw[s] comparison with the work of ives and carter, central african polyphony, experimental gamelan and most especially the early modernist polyrhythms and cascade-like figures of stravinsky" - or, alternatively, draws comparison with bad dubstep made on a mobile phone by a cerebal palsic.  *shrug*  well, i jest, intellectually i can equally see where he's coming from, but i'm not especially blown away.
oh, and lest we forget: 

[codeine, "pea"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfis2iuizy4) is as bleak as bleak gets. the only color is from slowly blooming bruises.

one of my favorite albums.  i can't listen to it much.  i only listen to it in autumn.
sorry, i don't see the appeal of brahms.  the rest are fine, though, particularly respighi.  the version i have (montreal symphony orchestra, charles dutoit conducting) is superb (and it includes the third roman suite missing from the article's linked recording).

as elsewhere noted, shostakovitch has some prime material; i recommend the 5th and 8th symphonies for your initial consideration.  if you can find a decent performance (i lost, or rather, wore out, my good copy, now i only have an utterly clueless performance by ozawa), prokofiev's 2nd symphony, was an explicit attempt at "metal" (that is, iron and steel, in his own words) music.

i was extremely disappointed by *relapse*.  i think the beats are sub-par, the lyrical content is abysmal and his rhyming flow has gotten weaker over time.  i didn't think he could make an album worse than *encore*, but i was wrong.

i've listened to it 3 times now, each time hoping it will get better, or at least grow on me a bit.  no such luck, though.

heh, i forgot to mention the rite of spring in my post, i only play it rarely now to keep it fresh.  stravinsky's petrushka is pretty good too (except the 3rd tableau, bleh).
i think we're all missing the larger crime here. (and by 'we're', i mean none of 'us', of course). that crime being the stealing of pre-teens' (parents) disposable income.

metal and classical are the only music. there is no other music. all other so-called "music" is *garbage* and not in keeping with 4 corner simultaneous 4-day time cube.
also give the first movement (le cahos) of rebel's [les  élémens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcqwrmqp9eo&amp;feature=related) a shot. in my opinion, the most metal the baroque period ever got. the opening chord is massive.

here's what [bbc says](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/j6w6).
some indie for you: [tegan and sara - "soil, soil"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2caec4ofkhe)

the entire album [(the con)](http://www.last.fm/music/tegan+and+sara/the+con) is a big cryfest, but this one really gets to me. i think the whole album is one huge story, but this song... i don't know. i love it.
it's simple.  any music i like is real and meaningful and artistic.  any music other people like is either pompous or soulless drivel.
tight pants with suit jackets? oh, i thought you were asking what their biggest crime was.
agreed. it's a great sound, but it doesn't 'own' you without that full bass/deep tones in the mix. found myself wanting to be taken somewhere, but the train just wouldn't go fast enough (does that make sense?)

you won't get downmodded because i'd like to think reddit is above downmodding someone for expressing their opinion. perhaps i'm talking to soon, but you have the right to your opinion.

eminem is widely respected as a talented wordsmith, nobel prize-winning irish poet seamus heaney even praised him at one point. of course i'm blinding by adulation, but you can't say the guy doesn't have talent.
metal is not noise..

i'm not saying les élémens first mvmt is noise, but it doesn't remind me much of metal.
ouch, killer argument (doing), but i'd like to repartee with the fact that the pointless nonsense is what got him to his level of popularity in the first place.
i would just like to point out for completeness sake that gary jules is doing a cover of tears for fears. but you are correct, that is the superior and supremely sad version.
well that's just lame. it's lush life as sung by johnny hartman from the hartman/coltrane album. if you are an imeem user, be warned that the copy that's available there is of very low quality. 
almost any of the earlier work of leonard cohen. 

particularly anything off of the [best of](http://www.discogs.com/leonard-cohen-the-best-of-leonard-cohen/master/26608) from 1975. and "hallelujah".
wow, metal fans listening to classical music?  how....cliche.

hell, while we're talking about nmh, half of avery isle and most of aeroplane could be in this list.  about the only songs on aeroplane that don't make me want to cry are the instrumentals.

i'm much more deeply effect by musicality then lyrics. beethoven's moonlight sonta makes me much sadder then that song did. 

the lyrics are sad, but the banjo and especially the trumpet kill any chance of that song being sad for me. 
their hairstyles.  their hairstyles were their biggest crime.
yeah, this article does a good job of glossing over the fact that the figure heads for milli vanilli didn't actually write, play, or sing the music.  all they did was put a face on it, and then accept a grammy based on the fact that they were the artists behind the music.  not really near the same.
not to mention the pointless nonsense is not eminem's **specific** defining quality which has made him so successful, it's just one of his many characteristics. thunderlungs is quoting a lyric from "ass like that", which is not meant to be a serious song, and he has had many more serious than ridiculous songs as of the last few albums.

this may be silly, but i just found out about porcupine tree not too long ago.  they're excellent in my opinion.  playlist.com has quite a few links to their music.
i'm not sure how prog rock they are, but i like moe. and umphrey's mcgee.
and the grammys are the purest form of acknowledgment going. just like the oscars. i think the larger point the writer is making is that either we don't care that much about authenticity or we're (thanks to the web) savvy to know it never existed. 

just like objectivity in journalism.
i don't know if king crimson is *still* producing music now, but i know that they were a few years ago.  and it is still as amazing as ever.  in fact, they're the only band i can think of that is capable of sticking around for thirty years without slipping into predictability or sellout status.  fripp is still the man.
listening to a song called deadwing right now, rocks.
i agree - it is a good read.  i disagree with the writer on the tendency to generalize genres, as i believe excellent music can be found in any genre.  

but, i do like the writing and ability to appreciate and compare the heavy metal and classical genres.
abigail, an evil wind is blowing through the land.
i think you're confusing the song lush life with the documentary about strayhorn.

great documentary by the way.
just about every musician on the face of the earth seems to shun the "prog" label so it is kind of hard.  most bands that could be considered as such tend toward the metal side, i.e. mastodon and dream theater (dt has a new record i am listening to it now).

they are not exactly traditional prog but the mars volta are just about my favorite band ever.  incredibly talented and totally unique in sound and structure. start with de-loused in the comatorium from 2003. if you like them dig backward toward at the drive-in (couple of the same members, but more of a punk sound).

if you like it heavy i recommend isis. if you like it really heavy and black try wolves in the the throne room. i just saw isis with pelican who are even more incredible and not quite as dark and heavy. pelican has no vocals ever though and that seems to turn some people off.  maybe porcupine tree or van der graaf generator as well.  hope this was helpful.
i think king crimson is the only band i can think of who actually have gotten heavier as they gotten older!  still great!
upmod because it's a great cover, but:

"reddit.com; what's **new** online"
imho those two are definitely more towards the jam band category, but pretty damn talented.  
yes, she plays and sings her music, which is not the same as milli vanilli.
tracy by mogwai
she's so bad they had to autotune the lip-sync recording?
incidentally, the producer behind milli vanilli, frank farian, already had a reputation of unscrupulousness. he 'wrote', in the sense that he put his name under it and got the royalties, a lot of songs for boney m and others that later turned out to be based on existing songs. 
odd. the banjo and trumpet are my favourite instrumentations in that song, and only serve to make it sadder for me.
sad how the world has devolved since the days of the funk brothers...
i would investigate that a bit further.
cat power - i don't blame you

madonna managed to become allpowerfull without autotune. and she really couldn't sing worth shit. crap has been a prevailing feature of popular music since the stone age.
not totally accurate. the voice is britney, but it is enhanced--sometimes very much so. milli vanilli had totally different people singing and they pretended it was them.

if they could actually sing, play instruments or write music, that would've been one thing.  hell, even if they pulled a britney and took a million takes to get it right in the studio then lip-synced when they were live, that wouldn't have brought all the scorn they received...  but they clearly defrauded the public by pretending they could do any of it and receiving an award that better, more talented musicians struggle their entire lives without ever seeing.  fuck milli vanilli.
i admit i just remembered seeing the mars volta on the rollins show, spent the first few minutes of the song just trying to figure them out. i will check them out, thanks

uh, judging by most comments concerning hip-hop on reddit ('rap sucks rofl. i once heard this song by a rapper and it was horrible so because this i knew the entire genre sucks') i don't get why they are paying to advertise this.
i live in decatur ga. this is the biggest yuppy town town ever. i can't imagine it would produce any hardcore gangbangers, but i don't know all the areas so i could be wrong.

apparently, [she changes all the notes](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a9c_1219341209). that's why they need autotune.
wonder what dylan would sound like on autotune.
that is the ugliest guitar i have ever seen in my life.
hey don't get me wrong. i love actual rap. however akon and his whole "crew" are all about autotune. this is not rap. they are not "gangsta".  
  
and, to gtbth's point, i am a fellow decatur dweller. there is nothing "raw" about this town at all.
ain't that the truth.
porcupine tree is a great band, one of my favorites definitely.  i'd recommend checking out arriving somewhere but not here (as well as the rest of the deadwing album), plus the albums fear of a blank planet and lightbulb sun.
these days? much better. don't be hatin', the man shouldn't be charging money for admission to his shows - not anymore.
at least mv kept the same voice, unlike m&amp;m who changes voices by the record.
well, *trouble* was a semi-decent album. you are right about the rest being crappy though. just making the point that even if it were some wu-tang a decent amount of redditors would piss their pants at rap being mentioned and jump at it.

there was a brief video clip on some music documentary with madonna singing untouched in a recording studio... what we hear on her released recordings and that is chalk and cheese.
there was news about software that can deconstruct a music recording, and produce the key structure and envelope sounds ! previously it was exceptional producers with skills that could pull hits out of hats, these days expensive software can do the donkey work, but always gigo if used badly by morons.

music is a billion dollar business just like the stock market, so science is always there to help producers/players work better.
mars volta. /endthread
the lyrics are hilarious.  the best part is the fundies will still think he's serious.

but the best part of it all is he harps about his weight and says, "i can't help it. i was born with a thyroid condition." 

it's a trip, it's got a funky beat, and i can bug out to it.
many singers are good because their voices are not perfect, but they are distinctive and have a gravel type appeal.

pogues are a very good example of a singer not having an angelic voice, but that doesn't matter because his voice is a force.
bob dylan - idiot wind - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbkkomfvjjc
[sufjan stevens - john wayne gacy jr.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otx49ko3fxw)

the only song that has ever brought me to tears.
it's her voice after going through a computer. just like her flawless skin and perfect boobs after going through photoshop. and she "writes" ?  riiiight. she sits down with a middle-aged songwriting veteran who does 99% of the work and she mutters "let's write a love song" and that gives her writing credit on the album. pure bullshit, but hey, i hate to be such a snob, you know? it's got a good beat and i can dance to it.
his voice is frazzled to the point that he sounds like three wasps trapped in a jam jar, but he's still dylan, and his writing has developed a lot of soul lately. 
girl, you know i do.
but he doesn't write anymore, he just does his old songs and covers songs he likes - dylan hasn't written a song himself in years.

* or so i've heard
that kid is now scared.
are you sure? he has all the songwriting credits on love and theft (2001) and modern times(2006) he has re-worked the traditional material enough for it to be considered original.

in an interview he said that he writes by playing a traditional song in his head until it changes into something new.
i'm not saying that britney is some kind of pop icon that demands your respect. i don't even know why anyone would particularly care about her.

but it's really not the same at all as a band that paraded their music about as their own and received a grammy for it, despite the fact that they contributed nothing other than their dreads and (admittedly saucy) dance moves. that's simply not the same thing as playing and dancing to a recording of the artist's own voice. at least she in some way or form did something having to do with the music that was played. 

milli vanilli just combed their hair, jumped up on stage and danced around. it's not very hard to understand. it's not the same thing.
i agree totally. if what the artist is *currently* doing doesn't please your ear, then don't see the show when they come around unless you can handle stuff outside of your comfort zone. i remember seeing neil young during his [greendale](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:2m861vf4zzma) tour with a full cast and everything - people were bitching all around me 'cause he wasn't playing southern man and heart of gold (the second set covered that) and they were getting impatient. some people even left halfway through, disinclined to wait around till the greendale bit was over, even though they paid like $40 a ticket. 

pearl jam is a bit different because they more or less have kept their original sound intact, whereas pumpkins (in addition to the personnel problems) and consequently corgan, were much more likely to experiment with different directions. also, eddie vedder had some problems of a slightly different sort with his fans over his politics, i think.

if you've made it this long as a famous musician, you really only have 3 basic choices. one is to keep reinventing yourself. one is to perfect your formula and put out solid album after solid album of whatever it is you do best. and the final choice is to walk away and do something completely different. to stay the same is to run the risk of boring your audience. to change is to run the risk of displeasing your audience, which is exactly what's been happening to corgan for a while now. to walk away is to risk losing a vocation that made you very happy. of course, these aren't mutually exclusive. 

what's really bizarre about the whole corgan thing is that he has indeed started to milk as much money from the 90s as possible, but at least in my opinion, he's not doing it (only) for money. selling today to a visa commercial is one thing, but actually *starring* in a pro wrestling pay-per-view spot? out of all the offers he probably had, that choice is too weird to have been motivated by financial gain alone.

[god damn the sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqo5c4jxsvk) by swans. it's just misery in song form.
yes, little birds! the saddest song ever
according to several sources she plays piano, writes some of her music, and she certainly sings her music too.  now whether she does any of these things well is up for debate.

playing piano takes time and dedication, so does singing.  if she made it through school, she can learn to do both.

writing music...pop music on top of that, once you learn how it is done is blindingly simple.  more so than playing or singing.  pick a key, pick a chord progression from that key for each portion of your song (verses, bridge, chorus) then write lyrics to them (every school girl can write a stupid poem)...once that's done, have a professional high-powered pop producer (like mutt lang) do your arangements.

i understand you probably don't like her...but don't underestimate her.  she did get popular mostly on her looks and luck and promotion, but i'm sure she knows more about music than your average listener.

billy has always been a fan of pro wrestling, actually. in this case, he did it more for his inner wrestling geek then for the money, i would bet anyways.

i'm actually surprised he hadn't sold a lot of his songs off earlier. i can't think of how many producers would kill a town full of orphans to be able to play disarm in a movie.

[this has to be one of the saddest cash songs i have heard.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s83x9ou5zk)
my favourite sad song is kyu sakamoto's "ue o muite aruko". i used to listen to it a lot when i was a kid and it just evokes so many nostalgic feelings. anyway, here is the link to the youtube video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtxq31f1a-k](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtxq31f1a-k)
well the thing is, britney can sing in tune (she was singing well as a kid and her first album came out before autotune was the norm).

even then, autotune can't save the color/timbre of a person's voice. just because you're singing in key doesn't mean your voice sounds any good.

...and if a singer is really bad with pitch, autotune will just makes them sound like a robot anyway (which admittedly, seems to be acceptable nowadays).
although i found that scene to be really sad, i found that part where he just gives up his tennis game a lot more depressing. it made me all teary-eyed, and i don't even know why.
why not, i enjoy doing it.
when the layered vocals come in at the end of play crack the sky... it gets me every time.
what were they thinking? maybe what, 10% of reddit at best buy rap?

the only thing rap is missing is the c.

edit: really? only one of you got it?
i'll definitely vote for him. too bad i'm not american. 
what ah... what now?
ah, one point: autotune (and its various predecessors and studio techniques) has been the norm for quite some time... just not the overtly digitalized vocoder-esque versions popularized by t.i. and co.

how about some metal for classical music fans?  anyone?
the band i am referring to is from vancouver bc. they play a style called skankcore (metal sub genre they are essentially pioneering by blending ska and metal with funk grooves). in 2007 they recorded an album with gggarth richardson(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garth_richardson). they shopped the album to all sorts of record labels, but it seems no one is interested in taking the "risk" of signing a band that is toying with a whole new sub-genre. they have toured across the country a few times, and had some success's (like opening for some bigger shows here and there). but beyond that, these guys still play hall shows and are broke. how can they do it? how can they 'make it' these days without support of the failed music corporations.

this is a link to hear their tunage if you care to hear:

i believe you may have missed the "jk" my good sir. glad to be personally insulted if it makes you feel better though.
awww... i was looking for a metal/classical mashup. i guess i'll go back to my e.s.posthumus.
umm if i remember correctly milli vanilli was caught lip synching to other peoples vioces, at least britney can use some distorted version of her own.
girl you know it's girl you know it's girl you know it's girl you know it's...
i'm exactly the same way.

if a song's instrumentation is sad the singer could say _anything_.  i ignore lyrics almost completely and instead the vocals enter my brain as just another instrument.  lyrics have no effect on me on their own; this is why i find poetry boring and tedious.

this song doesn't do anything for me either.  the words are simple and sad but without the proper musicality it doesn't evoke any emotional response from me at all.  and i've lost loved ones to health issues too.
[necrophagist](http://www.last.fm/music/necrophagist)
i would say he was traumatized.
you can't dance like that and expect to sing simultaneously.  for sure most pop singers will lip sing to their recorded voice if they dance.

i used to visit all the very gay places

those come what may places

where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life

to get the feel of life

from jazz and cocktails

the girls i knew had sad and sullen gray faces

with distingue traces

that used to be there you could see where
they'd been washed away

by too many through the day

twelve o'clocktails


then you came along with your siren's song
to tempt me to madness

i thought for a while that your pointed smile
was tinged with the sadness

of a great love for me

ah yes i was wrong

again i was wrong

life is lonely again

and only last year

everything seemed so assured

now life is awful again

and the thoughtful of heart

could only be a bore

a week in paris will ease the bite of it

all i care is to smile in spite of it

i'll forget you i will

and yet you are still

burning inside my brain

romance is mush

stifling those who strive

i'll live a lush

life in some small dive

and there i'll be

while i rot with the rest

of those whose lives are lonely too

very true, i think it's more the fact that i'm a guy who constantly listens to them. 

would seem off to anyone more normal, luckily i'm weird enough that i don't care that i'm listening to lesbian twin sisters. plus it's convenient because any love song they write is always about a girl, so we have that in common!
i read this as if the author had a lisp...
according to that wikipedia page:

"he learned the accordion from his father and practiced for hours indoors as, being albino, he was incapable of working in the fields with the rest of his family."

he has a few symptoms of albinism including, eye misalignment ("crossed eyes" or "lazy eye"), and very light skin and hair, and furthermore; there are two types of albinism one just affects the eyes and not the skin and hair so you can't really judge without seeing his eyes up close. besides, albino's with the hair and skin one (oculocutaneous albinism btw) aren't going to be necessarily snow white, sometimes they can have a relatively normal hue. 

thanks wikipedia for making me seem like i know stuff about albinos.

it's german, but hands down the saddest-but-beautiful song i've ever heard:

[herbert grönemeyer - der weg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh-r3uytpig)

grönemeyer wrote that song in memory of his wife. it's become sort of a funereal hit in germany.

translated lyrics of the first verse:

i can't see anymore

i don't believe my eyes

i'm out of faith

feelings have turned

.

i'm much too tired

to surrender

it'd be too soon anyways

because there's always a chance

.

we were co-conspirators

would have died for each other

we bowed the rain

we borrowed trust

.

we tried to turn

on a downhill run

nothing was too late

but much was too soon

.

we pushed each other

through hell or high water

we got caught up

and loved desperately

.

we denied the truth

as best we could

it was a piece of heaven

that you were around

.

you filled every room

with sunlight

turned every worry

into its opposite

.

nordic noble

your gentle mercy

your indomitable pride

the best i'd say is to find blogs that post megaupload links of albums of certain genre's that  you like. for example, i like lucidmedia.blogspot.com . 

if you want to go a more casual route than downloading a ton of albums until you find one you like you could try last.fm . you can search for artists you like and it will show similar artists that you may not know about. or you could install the scrobbler which tracks your mp3 plays and then gives you recommendations.
symphonic metal and power metal and all of those kinds are, but many other kinds definitely are not. black sabbath was a blues band before they sang about satan.

metal is a pretty huge umbrella as far as genres go. making those kind of (sarcastic) generalizations are silly.

you could say the same thing about mc hammer. he was criticized for sampling music!

if he released hammertime (or whatever his first album was called) no-one would say anything.

right, but to be fair, the predecessors (manually highlighting a section of a wave and then correcting the pitch with trial and error) was so tedious that it wasn't something that engineers would be willing to do to save an entire performance. if you messed up once or twice in the song, you could use that, but the autotune (even in the mid-90's) wasn't that prevalent.

really, a mediocre singer (like madonna for instance) can sing in tune if you they'd just take the extra 5-20 minutes to nail each take. people are just too lazy to do that and now we have singers (like madonna) that just rely on autotune rather than nailing each section.

i remember when that group first came out, and i walked into a cd store and saw the single. my first reaction was, "holy shit, a new lfo single! and there are a surprising number of copies of it here." then i looked at the douchebags on the cover and briefly wondered if mark bell had fallen in with a different crowd. i think i actually heard the song for the first time a few days later.

so i always hated them for stealing lfo's name and getting my hopes up.

i get a sense that the camera man is scarred to show the child's fingers (or the horrible score which the boy seems to be looking at), not that i think it's fake of course. why? because the playing actually sounds bad, which is good (for a 3 year old). but prodigy? this 3-yr old playing largo from dvorak's 9th symphony sounds much better.

this is a later release(2003). lfo used to be comprised of mark bell and gez varley, now (and for this track) it is only bell. for a taste of classic lfo that put warp records and the leeds bleep sound on the map check out the track [lfo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_aaqgncoau) released in 1990. if you have the chance to listen to this outside of youtube make sure to check the bass. it could seriously harm your system ;)

so is this band going to record any new material, or are they going to continue to coast of a couple of tracks that they originally released in like 2006?
i was just gonna say. thank you.

this is a great movie but they start playing music 2 minutes into that makes it hard to pay attention
loved this song when glen sang it with his band the frames, loved it when he sang it with his girlfriend in the movie once, loved it when they played it live at bonnaroo '08, and the only reason why i watched the oscars last year was to listen to them again and root for them to win best song....which they did :d

i commented about this guy yesterday when someone was asking who writes pop music. i'm a big fan of everything he did in the 90's, especially the robyn songs (my all-time faves [show me love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia2okrwnmze), [do you know what it takes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6kh3bqeqrc)) and of course, the bon jovi song.

i personally hate his work this decade though. the kelly clarkson and katy perry songs he's responsible for this decade just aren't the same. the production just isn't as awesome.
i looked this up this morning and was going to post it! :)  good show.  very interesting and impressive.
i've always been a great fan of his, he must be insanely talented.
if she understands the languages, then fair play to her.
i mean, obviously it's a guy, playing an acoustic guitar through some kind of delay box.  but, it sounds awesome.

is he somebody we should know?

also, the voice with the accent thing he does, have no idea what to call it but it really sucks and he shouldn't use it anymore. ever.

it makes me think of a dulcimer. probably because of the string hammering?

stanley jordan has been using this technique for at least 30 years (and without the need for delay)

see http://www.stanleyjordan.com/videos.html
yes it could (and is).
http://www.trainear.com/ is a hundred million times better than god damn good-ear.
"drifting" is the name of an andy mckey song.

this style of playing is tapping / hammering. 
sounds rather like stanley jordan might if he were ever produced by robin guthrie.
it takes a 9v battery and electromagnetically vibrates a guitar string for you, working especially well near to your wound-wire pickup.  it most commonly is used for a 'swell' in tone, theoretically like using a bow.
man that band is fun to listen to.
awesome, thanks for the info.
maybe, to some degree. 

as far as i know, stanley does not use acoustic guitars (very much - i will admit i have seen him use one on a couple of occasions).

not to mention stanley pretty much sticks to classic jazz.

when i think of two-handed tapping on an acoustic guitar, stanley's name does not jump to my lips, but michael hedges name certainly does.  not to mention andy mckee or kaki king.
wow someone corrected someone without being a dick. just to balance it out, fuck you.
you might also be interested in tapped-only string instruments like [the chapman stick](http://www.reverbnation.com/randypytel) or the [warr guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=925ilpufzaw). 
yeah, "hammer on pull off". 
thanks!  i knew about the chapman stick (i've wanted one since he started making them, but never could justify the cost), but i don't recall ever hearing about the warr before.
you should check out billy mclaughlan.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp5l2d1uslc&amp;feature=related
yup, she does.
naughty.
minus the bear is awesome, but for tapping i yield the floor to to [maps and atlases](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvbhkpkzwwq)

edit: [also here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2wb_wmgn4&amp;feature=related)
no way, dude!

kerry king is like, totally the most awesome guitar player ever!!!  rawwwrr!!!!
not saying i really love his music, just it's probably the best album name ever
oh my shit.

this man is a monster. he's filthy rich too, i bet.
fuck you too, dick!
i asked myself this the other day, and found it surprisingly hard to answer.  the r&amp;r hof considers the first year of eligibility to be 25 years after the release of a bands first album.  so who's most likely to get inducted in the classes 2000-2009?
it was billy mclaughlin who really brought this style to my awareness. he was the first of the tappers that i ever saw featured in mainstream media. his videos even used to play on the cctv screens at the mall near my house.

phil keaggy, although he doesn't do much tapping, is still probably the best acoustic stylist in my book.
beethoven does not play dice with the symphony.
nobody. a decade of mediocrity. '90 through '99 is a different story, though...plenty of talent that still needs a nod of recognition (listening to tool right now).
pelican: the fire in our throats will beckon the thaw is my favorite of late.
i would also suggest [tera melos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vesckng2rms).
haha. you think tool is better than anything that's come out in the past ten years?


i nominate out hud. best live show ever. ozomatli, second best live show ever. calexico is another great recent band.
yes there has.
*insert appropriate double entendre riposte*
if your music doesn't sell, what obligation does the industry have to hold on to you. it's a business not a charity 
do the killers count as a rock artist?
yes. and yes, in my opinion they should be included. but that might be mostly personal taste.
no but they deserve to be in the rock hall of fame.
usually i get bands that are okay, or have only one good song and the rest is cheesy stuff. this is the first time where i thought "k, good song, let me check out some other stuff..." and was actually pleased with what i heard.
more from the same album:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvnd5qren14&amp;feature=related
one of my favorite songs.  lyrics are awesome and beats are very fat.
while you're at it, check out [this guy](http://www.myspace.com/davidfloodgate) as well. the songs are pretty freaking good.
it's unfortunate that we're past the age of the guitar gods.
just picked up an album from 07 by white - alan white - drummer from yes, trevor horn - keyboard from yes (short stint) and the vocalist sounds like genesis era peter gabriel, not awesome but interesting none the less. that is the type of prog i am looking for and it seems as though no-one is attempting to fill that void today. prove me wrong.
he might produce "crappy" pop songs but come on, to come up with so much stuff takes talent and effort whether you like it or not
pretty sure that's a dude playing the music from a mutual fund commercial.
please rtfa. oftentimes, the label will sign you on to a deal where you owe them hundreds of thousands of dollars, but never release your record so people can buy it. they dont even give you a chance to sell. then they keep the masters to themselves so you can't even try to sell it on your own.
anyone know what the $18 + shipping actually gets you?  is it one d12?  a set?  does it come with a bag?  they do a bad job of marketing this on their website
that stairway to heaven cover definitely has some delay on it.
i like this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe_ykj61cs0.  sound quality isn't so great on this video, but his playing is worth it.
i'm fairly positive that mgmt are - given they keep it up - potential hof'ers. they're doing something that's completely new to the rock genre. by sticking close to zeppelin-inspired roots and splicing it with fun, bubbly, intelligent synth work, they constantly achieve a unique sound that will be looked back on as definitive of a genre.. whatever it may come to be called.
[second item down](http://www.philostore.com/)
not my cup of tea, but glad you like em.
especially when her brother pulls it out and uses it himself.
sorry, but the rock &amp; roll hof is a joke.
so he's street. but can he rhyme the words "bottle" and "model" in every single song?
after the post last week, i checked out some of his other stuff. this one was equally amazing.

bards ftw
coldplay.
as someone that's been trying to get even a taste of the industry for the greater part of 13 years, this is depressing yet not very surprising. 

i feel for these bands, but their "nightmare" would be at least a form of validation to a lot of struggling musicians. i mean, i'd be thrilled if someone would pay me tour support.
i think we're passed the age of the rock star. i mean, stereotypically speaking the only people i can think of that are by definition rock stars would be amy winehouse and britney spears.

though out hud did put on an amazing live show, [they're pretty much broken up.](http://www.brainwashed.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3358&amp;itemid=1)
true. stanley jordan is still the master of this kind of tapping technique. although i think i enjoyed stefano barone more. this was beautiful. as good as stanley jordan is, his sensibilities (and shoulder pads) are very early-90's. 
i'm just gonna add that anyone who has written off king crimson based on their 60's and 70's output really ought to do themselves a favor and check out discipline, by the 80s version of the band with tony levin and adrian belew. soooo good.
if you had watched the entire video, you would know that ;p 

check out some of the other guys on his label, a lot of them are similar in style (for example, don ross and andy mckee): http://www.candyrat.com/artists/

[search youtube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&amp;search_query=candyrat&amp;aq=f) for any of those guys.. they're all amazing.

true dat.  actually, i made this post while the video was still playing in the background. =)
the answer is the white stripes
been a huge mckee fan for a while. candyrat has good stuff.
wow i think that bands like m83 do the synth pop thing better. mgmt is good but i think that their popularity will come and go.
tv on the radio is looking pretty good so far.
nah, i don't like her at all, uhm, other than the parts that a male of our species is bound to like.  but even that is fading due to her behavior/personality.

but yeah, no doubt she's more of an entertainer than a musician.  but at least she's learned a bit of the music side.  some of them don't even go that far.

cheers, mate.
agreed.  that is the only band in a while that i could make it through the cd and listen to it repeatedly. both cds actually.
john frusciante, anyone?
&gt; both cds actually.

both? there are [three](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3vfexq90ldje~t2) so far.
you made me lol.
sounds a lot like explosions in the sky as well.
yeah, i did - using dice to choose your 12-tone row and some other educational applications of limited value to a student.  yawn.

even schoenberg tired of randomness in his composing: : "...as a composer i must believe in inspiration rather than mechanics."  he gravitated back to more tonal harmony in his later career.

i know it's futile arguing music on a primarily tech oriented site like reddit, but there is a love affair with randomness and chaos that is very tiresome to those of us who prefer music with emotional content, and pure randomness doesn't connect with the harmonies and order of the human mind and indeed the cosmos itself. 
i figured i was wrong, yet too lazy to open a new tab and check:p  ok i don't have the first one but i shall rectify that shortly.
*fapfapfap*
i used to practice in the same storage complex as maps and atlases, even tried out for another band who played in the same complex as well.

cool guys :)
it does indeed appear to be wholly without soul.
muse anyone?
bonus points for playing simple and pure *rock*, not some new age electro infused blah blah

edit: i actually quite like electronic music but if you are talking about a *rock* *and* *roll* hall of fame...
i disagree, dinosaur jr's "don't" is far more aggressive than most of sonic youth and nirvana's material. their first three albums are brilliant, everything since then (including this one, despite lou's comments) have been less so. still a powerful and tight trio, though.
i hear aphex twin has around 200 of these dice
i'm a bigger fan of people who can play the guitar the standard way and still rock it out, regardless of how stupid their hair looks.

what, no love for [justin king](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh_24dxny8e)?
adrien belew is in another band with a friend's father (the bears)...got to talk with him a couple of times, and had dinner with him once.  nice dude!
fun fact- not long after this, tina weymouth, chris franz and jerry harrison approached adrian about replacing david byrne as frontman of talking heads. he almost took it- it was a good opportunity, but he didn't like the way it was being presented- it was all behind david's back, and the rest of the band kept going back and forth about the money.

then robert fripp phoned him up and asked him to join the newly reformed king crimson. i think that was a no brainer.
the same could be said for the ability to write annoying earworm commercial jingles. in other  words, painstakingly well-crafted slime is slime.
i saw david byrne play the orphieum theater in phoenix last year. it was the best concert i have ever been to.
it's sometimes startling the sounds the human vocal cords can make. 
offtheboard you fucking rock, dude.  
this band needs more attention! so good!
reminds me of andy mckee http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddn4mgas3n4

talking heads without david byrne is a bit like talking without a head.
i prefer this version more: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcz5e5tn4i
that album ["the heads"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_talking,_just_head) put out will attest to that fact.

edit- linky.
sounds/looks like she's drunk. 
i listened to it, he will never be the same since black on both sides... he needs to get back with kweli and do another black star album.
which part
you have to add the young liars ep too even though one or two of its tracks are on desperate youth... that title track is probably one of the greatest songs i've ever heard.
i agree with you. i just went through my itunes to see what i had and realized i could find tons of stuff from pre-2000 i would give my vote to, but really couldn't find anything from post-2000 that has, or may have, some staying power.

i do think the band liars are pretty awesome for a post-2000 band, but i don't know if they'd ever be considered rrhof material.
what?  i wasn't even attacking commercial music.  my problem is with the institution itself.  

for example, how does eric clapton get inducted **three** times before miles davis even gets inducted?  eric was inducted in '92 as a member of the yardbirds, '93 as a member of cream and in 2000 as a solo artist.  miles wasn't inducted until 2006, 15 years after his death.  furthermore, there aren't even any other jazz musicians in the hall.  no ellington, coltrane, monk, mingus, etc.  so john lee hooker (blues), marvin gaye (r&amp;b), parliament-funkadelic (funk), metallica (metal), the clash (punk), run dmc (hip-hop), eric clapton three times and john friggin mellencamp are in the hall, but no jazz?  there's a couple in the "early influences" category, but that's all.

it's also obviously not just about rock &amp; roll, as so many other genres are represented.  but where's prog rock?  where's krautrock?  there's zappa, no genesis or king crimson?  no can or kraftwerk or faust?  not commercial enough?  well then why is the velvet underground in there?

also, the voting process isn't even legit, jann wenner just picks in the end. (http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258664,00.html#2)


david byrne is completely nuts, but he sure can make music!
yeah, i agree. pop songs are meant to be catchy, jingles are meant to be memorable. it's like getting your specialty in a shitty field of a decent career, like proctologists for example...
awesome, awesome live show. i saw em with portugal. the man and rx bandits, probably the best show i've ever seen. they just ooozed of talent.
it always starts with happy banjo music, then at some point you end up running through the forest trying to protect your cornhole from hillbillies.
urge to slap thighs... rising...
hybrid - i choose noise 
i cannot express how awesome i think this album is.
it's all fun and games 'til someone loses their ass-cherry.
i'm too lazy to look it up now, but apparently they paid that kid a few bucks for his role, he went on to live a quiet life in georgia, always a little insulted that the directors picked him strictly because of his strange looks.  he's not inbred, but had bad vision, which accounts for the squint.  i think.

edit: no matter what his deal was, he was fuckin' creepy in that; no cgi or modern sfx could capture such strange expressions.
db's still got it.

i saw him on his latest tour earlier this year. absolutely fantastic (and [here's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/65709822@n00/sets/72157617137768137/) a few photos i took if anyone's interested.
i think this technique was popularized by a guy named preston read. but i may be wrong.
i used to live maybe 30 minutes from where that movie was shot.
[billy redden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/billy_redden)

&gt; to add authenticity and humor to the film, the filmmakers found redden to fit the look of the inbred and mentally retarded banjo boy called for by the book, **although redden himself is neither**. the scene depicts redden playing the instrumental dueling banjos opposite actor ronny cox on guitar. because redden could not really play the banjo, another young banjo player knelt behind him and reached around his chest to reach the banjo, with redden wearing a specially made shirt that made the man's arms appear to be his own.

it's all just talk
i agree with the other nin songs mentioned, but i can hardly believe nobody's mentioned somthing i can never have, that one kills me every time.
probably the best version of  psycho killer i've seen. the last minute or so is amazing!
idea is not bad, just not a fan of this style of music.
i heard this was one of the creepiest movies ever.
music sucks, but the video is pretty interesting.
crap
started in 1994. muse is great &amp; deserves a nod, but they don't fit this time window.
ah, it's a pity there is no live version of "memories can't wait" from back then.

http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/song/memories_can_t_wait/16263611
started in 1997. if meg keeps her head together and they don't split they most surely will be inducted eventually.
u2 clone started in 1998.
"the heads" album isn't bad but certainly isn't talking heads.

and i could say the same thing about byrne's solo work.
out hud started in 1996. ozomatli, 1995. calexico, 1996.
absolutely. tool is a "superband" (rush, audioslave, and velvet revolver are other examples of superbands) made up of extremely talented musicians that take the time to try to expand what can be done with their instruments. i haven't heard any bands of unknowns come out of the woodwork in the past decade that can hold a candle to tool's raw talent, originality and influence over budding musicians. all the truly influential artists have their roots in the nineties (edit: ...or earlier).

kings of leon.
there have been a few bands formed since 2000 that i would give my vote to, but they are all made up of pieces of bands started in the nineties, and have all broken up without producing enough material to stay relevant 10 or 15 years later. this will hurt their chances of ever getting into the hof.

i like liars. they try to do something different and don't fit the mold. like you said though, they have little chance of being considered, probably due to the hof's penchant for recognizing popularity over influence. 
just interested.  who is your friend's father?  i love the bears, psychodots, the raisins, etc.
ok.

first one reminds me of the aliens movie for some reason.

second one comes off across a lot like the second mp3 from your last comment.

i don't really know what to say about the third one.

fourth one sounded like regular music.
sounds like the single that madonna didn't put out in 1986. 
i used to play in a band in which all of us were obsessed with yahtzee. any gig we'd play, any practice or just hanging out, we always had 5 die and some paper. we eventually worked out something similar to the musical d12 where we'd base the time signature on the dice we rolled (1 gets a 1-count, 2 = 2-count and so on). we'd roll all five and each person would follow the dice in whatever order they wanted, resulting in a kind of random number generator polyrhythmic nonsense. good times. i definitely want one of these d12.
the future of muzak seems assured.
its a very good movie. 
it's so fucking cool that they had to make it unavailable in switzerland.
lovin' this.
very good. if you haven't seen it, it's a great one to watch late at night all alone...
wow. that was pretty terrible (as someone who appreciates nick drake's music quite a lot, and is ambivalent to positive about most ej)
to this day i am still emotionally scarred from this movie.
he really thinks he tops sinatra?
i realize it's probably on the cheesy side for real metal fans, but i did actually rather enjoy cacophony.  i guess what i'm mostly wanting is classical music with metal instruments.  thanks!

bob nyswonger...i dated his daughter for nigh on 3 years back in high school. i'm still friends with her, so i see bob (and his wife laura) on occasion, but i used to be over at their house alllll the time. bob's got a really cool semi-professional studio in the basement with tons of gear (tubes out the wazoo) and unique instruments (including an old school wire-patch analog synth). i never really got into the posse's particular style of music, but all those guys are cool, laid back dudes. the rest of 'em (arduser, fetters, etc.) actually hung out more often than belew, who more or less just flew in for shows.
ive been waiting for rap to turn on autotune.  shit sucks.
i absolutely love bon iver, nice post.
good video, the music is pure *shit* though
i realize that, and that's why i feel like they need to get some recognition for their brief moment to shine.

__________

that site looks pretty cool. shit, they have [foetus](http://brainwashed.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7588&amp;itemid=1) on their front page. if anyone deserves to be inducted into the hall of fame, it's jim foetus.

but seriously, looking over their blog, i feel like i stopped paying attention to new music for about a minute and now i'm completely lost.
good message, but i'm really not a fan of the track. the flow is somewhat awkward on it, and the guitar just winds up being annoying.
well, yes.
sinatra was a great singer and a passable actor.
jay-z is an incredible rapper, producer, businessman, public figure, &amp;c.
thanks, this is...dare i say...beautiful.
i concur.  stanley if one of my all-time favorite artists.

as a matter of fact, my love of jazz stems from my discovery of stanley back in the 80's.
unfortunately the younger generation will not appreciate what jay z and the older generation of rap artists have done.
someone had to say it.  
that's very cool.

i first saw "the raisin band" with bob, rob fetters, chris arduser and tom toth (later to record on his own as tom caufield) back in 1976.  at that point, they were a cover band who played a handful of original tunes.  i was about 13 years old and they had the occasional gig where us non-drinking age kids could go and watch rock acts.

being able to connect the dots years later, i actually remember sitting outside one place called colby's and listening to sweetheart, a band from nashville that featured adrian belew.  i had no idea who he was at the time and in fact upon seeing their promotional picture, decided they weren't for me.  i think they wore kind of gangster-y sort of costumes...at least for the promo pic.  who knew what i was missing?

over the next couple of years, arduser and toth had left and were replaced with keyboardist rick neiheisel and drummers mike hodges and eventually rick "bam" powell.  while hodges was the drummer they made a local television appearance that was simulcast on fm radio.  it was a weekly program that featured local acts.  i recorded the show on cassette tape and played the shit out of it for the next few years until i was old enough to see them in nightclubs.

this was about a year before putting out their eponymous album produced by adrian.  i actually read about it my freshman year in college at southern illinois university when king crimson came through town and he'd mentioned in an interview his association with the raisins.  i was a huge zappa fan at the time and was super surprised that someone cool enough to have played with frank and king crimson was some how associated with arguably one of my favorite bands.

even at the top of their local and regional popularity where they were pulling pretty large crowds and getting reasonable amounts of airplay, they've always been an approachable group of guys, however i always gave them their space as it seemed that they were forever being inundated by fans wanting to make their acquaintance and so never really got to know them beyond a few chance meetings.

i only recently requested to be bob's friend on facebook and he was gracious enough to accept.

he's a great songwriter and an incredible bass player and i actually prefer his work with bands (bucket, farm report(?),  other than the bears, as i prefer a more straight forward and less cluttered approach to power pop.

anyway, enough of my jibber jabber, thanks for the insight.

&gt; ive been waiting for rap to turn on autotune. 

that is a *very* ambiguous sentence. 

are you out of touch and just don't know that rap has been using at for a couple years, or are you looking forward to a rap revolt against at?
i think he meant he was waiting for the the genre to "turn on" it. like, turn away from it. 
everything i've heard from him lately has his flow sounding a little off... definitely shows how far from rapping he's been in the last few years.  good thing i can always throw on reasonable doubt...
i've been listening to jay-z for years.  i am actually feeling this track
mp3 here:
http://www.zshare.net/audio/61029203b9fe2c82/
brave?
an upmod for you, kind sir. they're still probably my all-time favorite band.
greatest rapper alive. 
i've seen him twice now, both at folk festivals. great both times- and i got to chat with his bass player after one of the gigs.

my only disappointment was that both gigs were shortish, and hence light on the solo stuff (which i love, myself). but- the first time i saw him, when he started playing "once in a lifetime", i suddenly understood all those freaking out beatlemaniacs- i was right on the edge of being totally overwhelmed by emotion. i was choking back tears through most of the song. it was a pretty awesome experience- and though i've seen many of my all time favourite musicians live, i've only had that happen the once.
"melody" and "felony" may have passed "fire" and "desire" as the most overused rhyme.
not the best jay-z track, he probably threw it together in no time at all, but it's nice to hear jay talking shit again.
while i think there are some creative uses of it (ala busta rhymes 'arab money') mostly it's just a cheap way of fixing bad singers. if you got a note or two that needs touching up and you don't have time to re-record, ok, use it... but if you're running your whole vocal track through it, give me a break. it's so noticeable to any audiophile but most kids can't even tell. they think most of these guys have real talent or something. props to jay-z for doing this.
what, he gets downvoted for stating his opinion?
thanks for correcting me.
i know. given the context of this thread its not hard to figure out. 
i was simply pointing out how ambiguous the sentence was. i run across ambiguous shit like that at work all the time and all it does is make for more, easily avoidable, re-work. 
for the month of june, amazonmp3 is running a special promotion 50/$5: 50 albums for $5 each. these are 256k, drm-free mp3 tracks compatible with itunes and playable on any ipod.

you should submit this to: http://www.reddit.com/r/autotune/
the reddiquette looks down on useless comments like "lol".
how about i download them all in fully lossless somewhere else for free.
i actually wouldn't download these to begin with because i don't like many of them(i would like to see more on there). after that, if i am going to pay anything, i expect my product to be  at least cd quality, like what i get off bittorrent.  vinyl is the only music i will ever pay for probably.
this is why there should be no down arrow.  only up arrow and report.

i heard him one day on the radio and promptly bought one of his cd's. i owned them all within a year.

bacardi and party.

the classic.
&gt;seriously, though, does anybody still have anything positive to say about autotune?

we need to bring p-funk back. they synthesized their voices for the right reasons: **for the funk!!**
i hope someone remixes this with autotune. lol.
they gotta do it live
i think that's an alto sax.

edit: they're both in there. guess i found the sax more annoying on first listen.
$5 each
anyone else think it's funny that kanye has production credits on this track?
it's used on almost all pop singers voices, and not always as a vocal effect.
fucking nice. 
hypocrite.

u2 clone released all four of their studio albums during this decade.
throat singing. good stuff.
the bulk of the music listening populace has no idea what at is. if you're lucky, you might get one who can pick it out as a "different" sound on the vocal. these same people will swear up and down that kanye can sing.

i like autotune, it's great!
for music that upholds a spirit classical musicians are going to understand quickly, i'd try these:

* demilich - nespithe
* atheist - unquestionable presence
* gorguts - obscura
* slayer - hell awaits
* at the gates - the red in the sky is ours
* immolation - close to a world below

great site about the best musicians in jazz history. inludes tons of information on charlie parker, art tatum, gillespie and else, including videos, records, biographies and more. cool stuff!
exactly, this guy is making millions by working with kanye who is the biggest offender of this shit
right, and tupac was the best of all time too wasn't he?
i'm not a fan of auto tune...but j could have done alot better...and has done alot better.
while he's at it, why not make a song called "death of derivative, rhythm-driven-4/4 music featuring formulaic vocals laid over tracks lacking any harmonic, rhythmic, melodic or timbre complexity?"

oh right... autotune is the problem, not crappy hip-hop
yeah but they're deathcab, so no one cared.
*sigh* yeah i should have seen that. =\

john lennon "mother"
puffy guy think so using auto-tune.
tupac isn't alive. read the sentence again.
yes he is
started in 1994.
ok
album release dates aren't the issue. it says rock artists since 2000. who they are as a band was decided before the window. all i'm trying to point out with my "started in" comments (if you look this thread is littered with them) is that the truly talented and influential rock artists of today almost all have their roots in the nineties. this decade hasn't produced anywhere near that level of talent. rock is in decline, much like it was during the eighties (most real talent of that decade had their roots in the seventies). 

the "u2 clone" thing was a dig. i have a problem with sound-alike bands who are afraid or unable to break new ground and do something different. oasis also falls into the clone category, and i feel they should never get the nod. and don't even get me started on the 10,000 creed/nickleback (chicken/egg?) clones clogging the airways...coldplay are capable of doing something different, they just don't seem to have any vision that is uniquely their own.
my 10 year-old son is so sick of autotune.  even when i use it on my hobby songs! (or especially)
not really feeling the track, cos i know jay's done much better stuff than this. i love the fact that he's speaking out against autotune even when his labelmate (kanye) basically used it to death on his last album. 
party boat.

no, seriously, party boat.
because that shit don't rhyme with anything yo!

if most new rap music sucks, can you really blame it on auto-tune?


incidentally, perry farrell, the vocalist from this track is the front man of jane's addiction.

the main thing i like about hybrid is the blending of various flavors that aren't commonly mixed together giving it a fairly unique character to it.
fuck it, we'll do it without autotune!
the answer is: yeaaaaaah

i don't consider myself a huge fan, but i like satch. sammy hagar kills it for me though. i just don't care for the guy. 
i'm feelin' this track, but i don't know why things have to be one way or the other. autotune is definitely played out for uninspired commercial use, but 808s &amp; heartbreak wouldn't work if it was mining the same vibe as graduation. meanwhile there's new shit like "this ain't no mixtape" from curren$y that blow away the autotune tracks without having to call attention to it.
am i the only one who thinks the shins ripped a lot of their sound from panis et circenses?
throwbacks are exactly that. 
it's about the ensemble not the "star".
they have singles and nothing else.

pitchfork.com - i'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for posting this, but i have found their musical choices to be pretty intelligent. do not be one of those people that feeds off of their suggestions, but as far as musical reviews/suggestions go, this is probably the best i have found thus far. 
i m so cool
i'm going to be that guy that says at the drive in was better.
obvious proof that instinct is more fun than logic. 
agreed. although the music that really "changes things" is usually hated anyway.
this is the point which someone asks if music is about construction or about emotion .(?)

damn, my google-fu is strong today.

thanks. that was a nice way to wake up this morning.  

my stupid/skeptical brain keeps wanting to gravitate towards: "oh she musta edited different takes!" and "i think she sped up the footage". why can't i just accept beauty, skill and talent...
that was truly amazing. thank you.
lol, are you kidding me? get the fuck outta here, you lame spammer.
this is not only excellent playing, but excellently filmed and recorded, as well. good to finally see a video of a pianist that has decent audio and doesn't spend two-thirds of the time panning across an audience.
this is a wonderful application of the [dies irae](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fmhms5cvsw). my favorite is, of course, [symphony fantastique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irezpuwiy98&amp;feature=related) (skip to 3:20) 
edit: nice way to go to sleep this morning.
you kidding right?

biggie smalls still kicks tupacs ass in hell.
phenomenal touch... mesmerising really.
how does one memorize such a (complicated) piece ? 
seriously! but as complicated as that seems, it'd be much, much harder imo to try and read it as you played. memorization is essentially and at that skill level/experience isn't really suprising.
i'm not sure if it's the correct term but i always refer to it as muscle memory. what you remember in your head is like the outline of the music, a weirdly abstract shape of sounds; as long as you hold on to that your hands seem to take care of the rest for you. on the piano particularly it's facilitated partly by the fact that a lot of what you play will be different permutations of chord shapes you already know, so probably what the woman here is recalling is not the position that every finger has to be finding at every moment, but rather how different hand shapes are being combined. that's how it always feels for me, anyway; it could be different for different people (and especially musical geniuses who just seem to experience and perceive music in a completely different way).
wow.

simply- wow. that was amazing! she must have spent thousands of hours practicing &amp; honing her skill..

ps: the 10 yr old in me wants to just creep behind her as she is playing furiously, and say "boo!".

she would probably kill me with the pianostool, but it would be worth it. :)
reminded me of that scene form alien 2, her hands are implausibly fast.
that was really gay, but quite cool at the same time.
every time i hear autotune i think of that cher song "do you believe in life after love". i always wondered why some many rappers wanted to be like her.
                
              

imo she is the god mother of auto tune.
                  


nice fade out at the end.
the past week has kind of been a creative re-awakening for me. if anyone has any ideas on how to make this better, i'm all ears, well eyes i guess.
she [cleans](http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/11/valentina20lisitsa2020c.jpg) up pretty good as well. 

edit: fixed link
once you're familiar with it, it's not hard.
she is one of the few exceptional pianists because you can see the emotion and passion in her playing; something that a lot of musicians lack or lose. they may be truly amazingly skilled at their craft, but most of them have practiced their piece so much that they have lost the ability to express themselves while playing. it's the same in any art form; if someone had asked picasso to paint guernica 50 times, the final piece while being much more refined would have nothing of the painter within it. when you can feel a piece of the performer in the music, that's when true beauty flourishes.

many years ago i attended a solo piano recital given by a young performer, who couldn't have been older than 15. at his age, i correctly assumed that the usual offender would be present within his repertoire: für elise. a beautiful piece, no doubt, but we've all heard it too many times by this point. i sat down in my seat sulking that the evening would be nothing more than a tedious run through, but how wrong i was. when he played, it was as if i had never heard the piece before - he was telling a whole different story with the music; it was his own. i was almost moved to tears, and it dramatically changed the way i now perceive a 'good' performance.
for me anyways, the hardest part is to learn to play the piece itself. by the time i have the notes down, i've completely memorized every single bit... sucking does have its advantages.

i'm not sure how the more advanced pianists do it, though.
[daft punk - aerodynamic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93-7vrfxns)
practice, quite simply.

if you do something enough times it becomes very easy to repeat. i'm sure you do things in your daily life at are equally as amazing feats of memory, such as maybe a long drive to work everyday?

i think the mistake people make when 'being amazed' by musicians in this context is thinking that this simply happened overnight.  even the best musicians practice pieces like this for dozens if not hundreds of hours before performance. all my professors in college, very talented musicians, would spend months of 6-8 hour days 3-4 times a week practicing for a recital. even for simple pieces we were expected at least 200 hours of practice before a recital, and our pieces were only relative to our skill.
dude, not cool to let 10 year olds have sex with you.
opeth
the strength in her fingers could probably put a few ninjas to shame. 
i could do that.
wow thats sooo cool sounding
me= pwned.
by sucking for longer.
i want to see her type.  it must be nutso!
you are simplyfing things too much so, there is no music gifted people, just regular folks who have a higher degree of responsability and desire to practice?
might be better to find a good video of them on stage that shows what you thought was great about them, and post that.
is there something particularly remarkable about being able to play this liszt piece?  i'm not saying that talented pianists aren't impressive, but like.. i sort of figured she must have a robot hand, or be a cg rendering or *something*.  
pics or it didn't happen
while many will disagree, i don't think that the visual aspect of music should be noted as crucial at all. *hearing* the emotion and passion is what's important, not seeing it. any visual aspect is just icing on the cake, and completely nonessential and irrelevant to the true nature of the performance.

of course, from an empirical standpoint, there are only so many variables that a performer has at his disposal to manipulate (while remaining true to the original composition); essentially, they are volume and tempo. as such, i can't help but imagine that "feeling the expression in one's playing" is actually valid, but from a musician's standpoint, i can't actually deny it exists yet.
yeah, sorry, my head is still mushy from sleep and i hadn't even considered looking for video.

ask, and ye shall receive:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzd1gtroafo

song starts at about 1:02.  i still don't think this does them justice (only live video i could find), but it paints a considerably better picture than the studio stuff, i think.
where is pearl jam on that list?
you know, you can come up with all the lists you want, but if you don't put reasons why you chose them, then this is just masturbation.

and if you're strong in your convictions, then stop saying 'this is going to piss people off.'
i'm sorry if i in anyway insinuated that the visual aspect of music is crucial; i meant the sonic passion most of all. to be frank, watching someone thrash their head around and pull faces while they play i find rather distracting; let the notes tell the story.
break it down into sections.  after a lot of practice, you just innately stitch the sections together in your head and you have a seamless stretch of memorized music.  i've always memorized sections of the song in context to each other this way.

remember how hard it was to memorize the alphabet?  it's a similar process, only with complicated musical passages rather than letters.
thank you, wow, she completely pwns that piano.
how, by being obvious and useless

u2 is overrated? get out of town?

who listens to barenaked ladies?

who listens to kiss

pearl jam? are you still in 1993. they have been doing their own thing since they became neil young v 2.0
no, but for the musically gifted to realize their gifts to the fullest extent requires a ton of practice.
very much so.  
that's a level of creativity i unfortunately will never aspire to - how well the group blends and how well they enunciate the english (they are slovenian, apparently) is really impressive..
what key is the beginning portion of this song written in?  it looks like mainly black keys are being played at the beginning.
i want to upvote this more than once! :-)

&gt;i don't think that the visual aspect of music should be noted as crucial at all

but the visual of the performer is crucial. music didn't just magically appear on records and cd's one day to only be heard and not seen. 

musicians have performed in front of audiences for as long as music has existed. only in the past  century have we created a medium that contains the isolated audio aspect of a performance.
they already do strange stuff, you should hear chopped and screwed.

edit: misread your comment.
90% of reddit could play that piece if they had the proper thousands of hours of practice. there are the truly gifted, but it's just about honing your craft.

i have a friend who is a professional pianist. he works eight hours a day on things i would consider repititive and boring. when i first met him, i still could see his mistakes. now, i can't. he's worked years to get that 5% improvement, and that is what makes a gifted artist.

now, there are also prodigies who pick an instrument up quickly, but that 80% is overcome by practice.
for some reason this reminds me of the oblivion soundtrack, with the battle music coming in at about 1:10. sorry, i don't know my classical music :/ anyway, very nice piece.
no tears for her totentanz frag, but lots of tears for her la campanella. another stunningly magnificent lisztian is boris berezovsky. here's his incredible mazeppa:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfn7xf6jymq
i'll post a few more in the same style, upvote them instead! :)
let's not forget [cziffra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sygs5yz7x5m)!
i'm one who would disagree.  i used to play cymbals (and other percussion) in an orchestra .  any percussionist can slam a couple of metal discs together and make a noise.  they can even control the volume, timbre, etc., without a whole lot of movement.  i added a visual component to my playing by crashing the cymbals in an upwards direction and flaring them out at the audience.  when i started doing that, people started coming up to me after the performances and saying, "oh, you're the cymbal player!  you were great!"  

the sound was the same, the only thing that changed was the visual aspect - the look of intensity.
youtube needs a higher frame rate to do this video justice.
my favorite liszt is still [hungarian rhapsody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bygi1mdi3no)
i like it.
thanks for linking directly to hq version, it's like night and day compared to normal mono youtube sound.
the piece can only be played with twelve fingers.
agreed.  despite their efforts to improve the service, i find desperately lacking. it would be even better to  have an xvid or x264 torrent than  crappy youtube video.
i still dont think that the hq version is a fair representation of her talent. especially the laggy framerate.
it's pretty good, but the [11th](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqyhlwziwjm) doesn't get enough love...
what about "girl" and "world"? every time i hear the word "girl" as part of a rhyming set, without fail, the word "world" is always rhymed with it.
there's also an hd version available if you start from the standard version.
evelyn glennie shows how to listen

http://www.ted.com/talks/evelyn_glennie_shows_how_to_listen.html
this song sounds like it *should* be awesome, but i just can't get into it, probably because of the way it's mixed. deciphering the lyrics takes too much effort - i can hear individual words, but then i forget what they were by the time a sentence has finished because i'm trying too hard to hear. (this is with headphones. i haven't tried speakers.) also, the bass frequencies need more presence, as others have already pointed out.
i still stand by my statement about the quality of youtube videos.  even their "hd" are not of very good quality.  far from true hd.
awesome video.

mr. bungle is one of my favorite bands. mike patton has an amazing vocal range.
hi, i'm looking for some good songs with horn sections or trumpet solos. any genre will do. it could be pop, rap, classical, i don't care. (btw, are there any famous country songs with horns?) i love how loud and energetic they sound, so something with a quicker tempo is preferred. thanks.
who in their right mind would pay to see this? truly one of the most horrid musicals i've ever seen. i didn't even pay to see it but i wish i could get those 20 minutes back (that's as far as i could make it)
[fleetwood mac's "tusk"](http://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/fleetwood+mac+tusk#watch%3de1131685gpf3gfw) is the first song to come to mind if you like marching band brass.

dimmu borgir's ["progenies of the great apocalypse"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joeab_y7zya) and ["eradication instincts defined"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxedezhky68) have brass and violin throughout, but it's mixed with death metal instrumentation and vocals.  
check out anything by beirut - they use a lot of brass. the album "the flying cup club" comes to mind - most of the songs have some brass.
the decemberists on their last album. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7fzugr8zh4

oh, man, you have got to hear **tower of power!!**  on itunes, [these](http://www.google.com/musicl?lid=ol3-g2-77ch&amp;aid=fgvwvccvmnj) top three selections are a *must* for any lover of "power-horn", "sweet horn" sound.

down to the nightclub, ah boomp-de-boomp-de-boomp!!
horn sections, well, as [seeker135](http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/8qk07/reddit_what_are_your_favorite_songs_with_great/c0a4ebg)rightly says the [tower of power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tower_of_power) horns are essential.  don't miss [this incredible live album](http://www.last.fm/music/little+feat/waiting+for+columbus) featuring the tower of power horns.  [quoth one review](http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=14760):

&gt; the presence of the tower of power horn section perfectly augments the recording, especially lenny pickett's self-emolating tenor solo on "day or night" and his electric one-night-stand with lowell george on "mercenary territory.

then there's the [memphis horns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memphis_horns).  their discography as house musicians for [stax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stax_records) is [immense](http://staxrecords.free.fr/list.htm), but my most essential tip would be the [king curtis](http://www.amazon.com/live-fillmore-west-king-curtis/dp/b000fbg06c/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1244416045&amp;sr=8-1) and [aretha franklin](http://www.amazon.com/live-fillmore-west-aretha-franklin/dp/b000fbg062/ref=pd_bxgy_m_img_b) live at the fillmore west.  king did an instrumental warm set up with the same (all star) band, before aretha came on to headline, the horns are phenomenal. it's hard to think of a more perfect bright, punchy horn section sound than their take on "signed, delivered i'm yours".

and of course much of the rest of soul / funk is equally fine mining for horns.

other random suggestions [showy trumpet solo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrlupskefek), [these guys have fat horns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prhhi0ljeny), [so do these guys](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw85bnfrt6k), [branford marsalis does too](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6aaah9woqk), [something different](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2huvuatp41g), [something rockier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huli90ldi88), [something slinkier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtfkmra5tsa), [something slinkier still](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovuvrbqhkxq)...

&gt;musicians performed in front of audiences out of necessity, **not because being present and visible was integral to the music itself**

is that a fact?

there is a mesmerizing quality watching a great performer on stage. hearing their work is a completely different beast than seeing/hearing/experiencing their work live.

if you're going to judge a musical experience based on the isolated audio aspect, then you're cutting out a crucial part of a musical performance, and remember, it has always been a musical performance (from the dawn of man until now), and in saying that musicians only perform live out of necessity (really?), i think you've shown what little knowledge you actually have of performance and music.




herb alpert and the tijuana brass, man.

just kidding. i think that was sampled from something else, actually. there's a good concerto i can't remember the name of right now...

going back in time to watch the beatles sounds like a great idea, until you get there and realize just how loud the screaming girls really were, and how you can't hear anything they're playing anyway
the beatles. 

i would kill to see george harrison in person.
in order of how much i like them, starting with the one i like the most:

- jupiter

- uranus

- venus

- mars

- neptune

- saturn

- mercury
you just made my night.
yes, cziffra rocked!
[kutiman - mother of all funk chords](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tprmes-zfqa)
i love this song. it's one of the songs that really got me into this kind of music.
i like the [venture bros. version of mars](http://www.gametrailers.com/user-movie/venture-brothers-warship/18113). (starts @ 1:30)
knock yourself out also has a ridiculous sax solo using 'circular breathing'
but, for now here's the top horns doing [soul vaccination acappela](http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=tower+of+power&amp;first=21&amp;docid=551299711362&amp;mid=65ec9434976bbaa867ea65ec9434976bbaa867ea&amp;form=vivr3)

(2 years old user)
how could i have forgotten the greatest version?? 
say what you will about their respective legacies, but i have never heard anyone say the beatles put on good concerts.  what i have seen and heard of them all anybody in attendance heard was screaming teenagers at all beatles concerts. besides the beatles were great because they wrote great songs.  the stones were great performers more so than great songwriters (although they wrote some pretty good ones too!).
uptight (everything's alright) by stevie wonder
that video made me really happy. is this a sign i need a therapist?
i've always loved the stereo separation on this track.
it seems to be a mishmash of various facts about [sir francis drake](http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=00cgzg).
i played this in 7th grade.

odd hearing this now...a lot's changed since then.

blue in green, from the miles davis album kind of blue. gets me every time.
one should look at art as captain planet.  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

humans created visual art and aural art at the same time and for the same reason: to tell a story and fix it in the minds of the participants and observers with the ultimate purpose of detailing their mystical beliefs.  while you may argue that aural art should only be evaluated aurally, because that's what it is, you miss the point that the whole reason we have music and art in the first place is to tell a story.  therefore, it should be ill-advised to separate each part of the performance.
the stones, who are still kick ass to this day.  
this is great because it's one of the few times that you can see something like that in wikipedia, and it's not just someone trolling or something.
wow, i can hear a lot of movie scores in this. the good, the bad, and the ugly, lord of the rings, i wonder if this inspired those scores.

edit: i think i hear legend of zelda in there too.
paul butterfield blues band "in my own dreams" 1968.

the song and album are great. blues, soul and jazz all wrapped up together.
i love this song. i used to sing it with my sister when we went road-tripping or camping.
voted gogol.
hell yeah, shit was badass
some of us realize that producing records and promoting artists does cost record companies money -- and even if they over charge for their products that doesn't make it right to take them for free and thus appreciate it when places like amazon offer a more reasonable rate for some of their music.
comment from my husband (lying next to me, sick, eyes closed), as the video started to play: "it sounds like water is spilling on your laptop; you should stop it."
actually, no - "gift" only gets you started. it is the extremely rare person (usually a savant to one degree or another) who can get by with hardly any practice. 

these musicians work really hard, physically and mentally, and it only minimizes their dedication to suggest that it's a "gift".
a lot of songs on "in the aeroplane over the sea" feature trumpet portions to some extent or another, btw, not just the fool.
there are actually upwards of 47 ninjas hidden on the page of the article, as well.
i love some of the old songs that were before country pop.  the soundtrack "brother where art thou" had some old and some original songs but a few had a great earthy feel. real grit. 
 po lazarus was one. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aksy2gx1dc)

in terms of punk music...

[firewater](http://www.myspace.com/realfirewater) does some pretty great horn tracks. 

and [world inferno](http://www.myspace.com/worldinferno) has a very strong alto/tenor sax and horn section.  

also, they're both spectacular live.  sorry for myspace links, but continuous play and better playback quality than shitty youtube videos wins for today. 
i know what you mean. i play the ney (turkish flute) and sometimes i go into a "state" where my fingers "know" what holes to cover/open. it happens more when i play pieces from memory. 
practice makes perfect....i wish i could practice more often. i try to put in at least a hour each day. 
you are thinking of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqah1rucyrg for the where's the beef commercials. (aaron copland, rodeo: hoe down).

i think jupiter is what they are using in the new reese's commercials (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2xtyjdsees), although i can see how they sound a little alike.
po lazarus

this is probably the song i enjoyed signing in elementary school. 
my favorite song off the album and the best one they do live. go see them they are on tour!

a couple pitfalls while making this week's tape, not the least of which that i didn't get to print it until about 11:30p on sunday.  when i started this series a month ago i told myself that it'd be just a bunch of rapid fire mixes, but i've found myself putting in more effort each week.  

enjoy!
yes, but it's none of your business.
what's with the pitch control?  sounds like it's played on a cassette walkman running low on batteries...

i remember playing this quite often back in the day when i was a dj at a classic rock station (also, back when i thought that was a cool job) and i remember it being a bit more lively. 
i think you missed the part where i differentiated from performance and music. if i want to judge the music of a musical, i must ignore the stage, but if i want to judge the performance, i must acknowledge the entire experience. if you are judging music, the only relevant sense is hearing.
that's about all the visuals i got the first time i heard this song at the beginning of "o brother..."
i am in love with her voice.
i make my boyfriend listen to this all the time, now that its on reddit he actually will listen to it, thanks reddit!
*perfect* practice makes perfect.
clever website name.
goin' to the party, sippin' on bacardi. wanna meet a hottie but there's adam, steve and marty...
it's hobo-heaven - they're not much for hygiene. it'll all be fine - there's a lake full of stew (and of whiskey too!).  
its been really cool.  i've already found some cool shit.  
hard to resist anything with the (super fucking cool) tag
i've only listened to 3 songs so far, but every time a new song comes on i'm expecting to be rick roll'd.
**favorite:** culture club - karma chameleon

**most hated:** reel people - the rain

i can't believe how my local radio station promotes this as the hit of the summer. it's exceptionally awful.
favourite: look at that caddilac - stray cats

most hated: anything on the top 10 really.
at the moment,

favorite:  paul gilbert - i cannot tell a lie    
most hated:  anything by lady gaga
*lady gaga*

correct.
favorite: dream theater - the count of tuscany  
most hated: none in particular. i guess [brokencyde - freaxxx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-th5ibabp4u&amp;feature=related&amp;fmt=18) would have to be mentioned, since it's the most recent 100% crap song i've heard.
actually, i believe the hof goes off the year the released their first album, not when the band was formed.  out hud's first album was in 2002, so they'd be included in this exercise.
actually, the hof bases their eligibility date on the release of their first record.  since "parachutes" came out in 2000, they'd be considered a 2000 band.
**favorite:**

band: scar symmetry
/ album: holographic universe
/ song: fear catalyst

i'm listening to this all the time these days. actually i'm playing the whole album on loop in my car, but i skip back for this particular song often.

**most hated:**

i'm not listening to mainstream music at all, so i don't really know. one of my all-time most hated songs is wham's "last christmas", though, and this song was played to me by a friend on saturday night, so my hatred is both old and fresh at once :-)

i think tool is a fantastic band, and agree completely.  great songwriting performed by the best musicians around (danny carey ftw).  they write their own music, and are not carbon-copy clones like most bands today.
perhaps even more disturbing than that video is the musicians on the song, including rock'n'roll hootchie-koo singer rick derringer, and springsteen/conan vet max weinberg!
*right now*, i've had [titus andronicus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knicoepfbwe) stuck in my head all morning.  check it out if you like noisy indie rock/punk containing many literature references and bruce springsteen influences.

i don't hate very much music.  i guess i'll agree with the guy that posted brokencyde.
**love:** [passion pit - sleepyhead](http://www.playlist.com/playlist/16530792203)

**hate:** fleetwood mac - landslide

ugh i just puked in my mouth a lil bit.
love: [state radio](http://www.stateradio.com/)'s [*people to people*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5j86f4aysq)

hate: wallflowers' *one headlight*  god i hate that song. in fairness, there are many songs which are far worse but this song was so overplayed that i never recovered. ...can't stand hearing it.
love: "son of a preacher man" - pulp fiction soundtrack

hate: whatever the hell the rapper on the radio in the next room is doing.  
i have a love hate relationship with [empire of the sun - we are the people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a47y1lcrhlm&amp;feature=channel_page).  
  
they strike me as trying to replicate mgmt's success a little to blatently but the song is pretty infectious.
hey, music sub-reddit

interpret some lyrics for me

i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
i'm just another member but i feel pretty confident in saying: listentothis don't play that game.
i got extra happy when the clavinet came in.
i'd also recommend lon gisland, probably my favourite album. *my family's role in the world revolution* doesn't really have any horn solos, but it has a good rolling beat with prominent horns. more horns than a metal show.
[walking away by streetlight manifesto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxjwrw-j85m&amp;fmt=18) features really wonderful horns throughout the whole track with a nice bass-then-horn solo thing at the start. it's ska, but a bit more of a mature ska.
wow.. awesome! thanks.

edit: how would i submit a video?
people to people is a great damn song. see it live if you can.

as trite as it sounds, given that it's by far their most popular song, i still find camilo to be both an awesome song and emotionally powerful, especially live.
**love:** too many to name, but if i have to choose what i'm enjoying the most *right now* i'd throw out "leaving me" (sorry, no good link) by zox and "[... and the battle begun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq0j2ot1nho)" by the rx bandits.

**hate**: that growly nickelback-style crap that's polluting the alt rock stations these days (see chevelle, nickelback, crossfade, etc.)

edit: great success! i found a link to "leaving me." [clicky](http://www.imeem.com/wiimusic/music/y--ihsfq/zox-leaving-me/). it's imeem, so you might have to register-- i apologize.
ew.
do not like.
favorite: cool kids- basement party

absolutely despised: any track with akon on it. his voice makes me want to gouge out my eyes.
not bad
i cannot upmod enough. i would argue that streetlight has the best horn section of any touring rock band right now. speaking specifically of *horns* i don't know their best songs offhand, but my favorite streetlight tunes are:

* a moment of silence (great horns in the intro)
* one foot on the gas, one foot in the grave
* keaseby nights ("when they come for me/ i'll be sitting at my desk/ with a gun in my hand/ wearing a bulletproof vest")
* we will fall together

seriously, duode, if you want horns, check streetlight out... it's tough to go wrong. in  a broader sense, try ska in general; lots of horns there.
that whole rx bandits album is amazing, i'm so excited for the new one coming out in july! upvote for you, good sir.
thanks for reminding me about the new grizzly bear album, i've been meaning to get that. i'm glad to hear it's good.
submit it to the [listentothis subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/)  it will be added to the list by tomorrow morning.    
i've just been getting into them-- they're tough to categorize, but i love most of their stuff. great example of what alt rock should be.
it's fucking *great*
don't stop beliiiiiievin'
i figured i should submit something that isn't spam-related or from one of the "popular" websites i visit on a regular basis...

so here you go!  don't hurt me!
here is jens lekman's song.  i know he samples horn and string sections a lot, but his song sounds like it was based on the above link by the chairmen of the board.  what do you think?

[jens lekman - the opposite of hallelujah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4k90j59lq4)
love: the album *the greatest story ever told* by the lawrence arms. one of my favorite bands, and such a great album, especially if you love drunken midwestern punk and obscure literary references.

hate: that song i hear on the radio that sounds like it's by beyonce and features the word "halo" repeated about a zillion times. ugh. 
almost anything by beirut
yeah, they used to just be straight up ska on their first couple albums, but nowadays they are some socially aware crazy punk rock jam band hybrid thing that i love to death. and their vocalist looked like jesus the last time i saw them live, can't argue with that.
yessss, this is what i came here to say. i remember being fucking blown away by their first album and how insanely good it was.
shes just terrible
one headlight? really? they never played in on local radio so it was never killed. was there a time that you did like it?
"my ding-a-ling" originally by chuck berry
&gt;"son of a preacher man" - **dusty springfield**
favorite: xtc - living through another cuba

most hated: those freecreditreport.com songs on tv
this is my favorite song period. it has some nice background horns and a solo. 

[living legends - after hours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhlzffsofm4)
poor kid
these guys are enjoyable. thanks for sharing. 
and if next week look at that caddilac - stray cats is in the top 10?
i was working in a record store when it came. heard it right away and thought, "*meh. it's ok.*" the wallflowers were a non-event to me. but then that song became a single and i felt like couldn't get away from it. it was playing all the time, everywhere i went. it was definitely on high rotation on several stations in my area. 
i suppose expecting actual musical discussion was too much for the people on this subreddit.  
i love me some cursive! their album *happy hollow* has a lot more horns since they lost the cello from *the ugly organ*, so they focused more on that.
very creative wedding rings. you can even tell which wedding ring is the woman's by looking at the sound wave intensities. 
fave: jarvis cocker - homewrecker!
hate: papa roach - lifeline

i don't even necessarily hate papa roach, but that song has got to be a joke.

honorable mention fave: sleepytime gorilla museum - the creature (hey, i just recently heard it for the first time)
honorable mention hate: seether - careless whisper (i would honestly rather hear the original, it rocks more).
i've been loving rx bandits since halfway between here &amp; there.  they've evolved so much since then and i always look forward to their new material and seeing them live.

one of my favorite live acts ever.
pretty cool idea, but women are usually more into dainty jewelry. those band rings are huge.
stuff could use a little color, too.

the "i do" rings are a nice touch though. i like how they're not exactly the same, even.
**love:**  the dodos
**hate:**  95% of what's on mtv and/or the radio.  i'm not kidding.
well then it wouldn't be true :p

i couldn't think of a particular n-dubs etc. song i hated the most so just the top 10 will suffice.
fucking hell, not n-dubz.
nah-nah-nai. what does that even mean?
i wonder what the wavesform for "i love you" looks like. 
fave: the black ghosts - anyway you choose to give it

hate: metro station - shake it
credits song from portal, if it's in your range. 
lovin' tera melos right now.

hatin' the song coming from the apartment behind me.


boom boom pow
can somebody make something like this for original music created by redditors?
favorite: birdy nam nam - the parachute ending
most hated: green day's new album
love: damion rice delicate

hate: the kiss me through phone 
loving old episodes of a state of trance.

hating nickelback and other clones of them, as well as lady gaga.
probably eerily similar to "i hate you".
uptempo brass? just about anything by:

- [liquid soul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxd2ah9dk6c)

- [brooklyn funk essentials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dievhxxkso)

- [galactic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7dfa3hoawq)

have you heard the new dt yet? how is it?
fav: passion pit -  the reeling

hate: i could go one forever...
i like the first and second songs on [this album](http://www.thefriendsociety.com/kwwrr/tjbc-bh3.zip) by a random internet guy i found at [the friend society](http://www.thefriendsociety.com/2007.php).

i hate the same thing i've always hated; your favorite band.
that "giggle" necklace is actually really cool looking.

i'd love to see jewelery like this, but with famous lyrics from classic rock. think "ramble on," or maybe "purple haze."
50/50. worth buying for sure, though. (i pre-ordered it... no, i didn't receive it yet ;)  
"a rite of passage" (first (only?) single) is the weakest on the album imo, which is a good sign, i guess. the album is quite a bit less progressive, and thus more predictable, than their earlier work. that's partly a good thing considering some of their extremes, but mostly bad.

imho.
cool idea but those edges look sharp. i would think that the rings would get a ton of lint and catch threads all over the place, maybe even tear up your fingers.
thanks.
get to see grizzly bear on saturday (with tv on the radio).  can't wait.  
as a girl, i'd rock this jewelry. i bet it's hella expensive though.
most loved: rick astley - never gonna give you up

most hated: rick astley - never gonna give you up
most hated: the song that goes "boom boom boom blahblah" and has autotune in it. i only heard it once, but it's horrible.

most loved: [nobuo uematsu - get happy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me7yf8rbwdw). it's what's helping me survive my finals. and by survive, i mean not kill myself - still going to fail.
and you can always play it off as a leaf if you're at a non-geeky function.
don't have any most hated right now. i tend to avoid music that i hate.

favorite--my freeze ray, by joss wheadon (performed by neil patrick harris). can you guess what dvd i bought last week?
this is cool, i had no idea where this sample came from
c'mon, money ain't a thing!
love: rare song, by obscure indie band

hate: popular song, by overpromoted talentless artist
i don't know about my favorite (ok, ok, it's 'soothsayer' by buckethead), but my most hated is whatever jazz piece my fuckhead coworker has on his phone for a ring tone that i have to listen to 100 times a fucking day.

either that, or anything ever done by lady gaga.  it's a tossup.
i'm geeky enough to think they're dead cool, but i'm a bit girly and prefer slightly smoother shapes.
wow, reposted blog spam.  yay!

holy hell that sounds like a beastie boys lyric.
if you're looking to be competitive: choose a song with a good vocal hook from a songwriter who doesn't have a great voice.  too many good singers come across as mediocre because they try to cover aretha franklin or freddie mercury and can't match the vocals.  leonard cohen is a good choice for songs, except for "hallelujah" which has been done to death (no jeff buckley pun intended).
love: leftover crack - [atheist anthem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgbw18g4soe) or [ya can't go home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gavk_laijee).

hate: britney spears - if you seek amy.  that shit is shockingly godawful.
**love:** never met a girl like you before - edwyn collins

**hate:** i can't stand any song by o.a.r.

**honorable mention:**  iggy pop &amp; the stooges *raw power* album.
hell yeah!  guided tour of chicago was rad also.
yay california

moanin' by charles mingus

that's all you need
it is when fall's first tuition payment is coming up :(
c'mon baby, money ain't a thing! [for me]
nadja - *the bungled &amp; the botched* is my favorite song at the moment. oh, well.
haha, definitely. also, i didn't know this until i saw a random rolling store cover with her on it, but she looks fucking freaky as hell, as well as making terrible music. maybe it was all the makeup and the weird costume or whatever, i don't know, it freaked me out though.
you can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe!
i wasn't aware you were using your fingers that much, dr. hawking...
do i foresee a transaction in the near future...?
it would be even cooler if the waves were from recordings of the client's voice.
sick!
new music? finally :)
i'd like to see this personalised to a voice recording, like me telling my missus i love her. she thinks it looks cool, but is probably expensive. if the waveform was infilled with another material it might be better, like maybe platinum.
* favorite: "everybody wants to rule the world" by tears for fears or possibly "unsung" by helmet
* most hated: "face down" by the red jumpsuit apparatus

both are a symptom of playing a lot of saints row 2 recently and the in-game radio stations like to bring these songs up a lot. the tears for fears song sort of became an unofficial theme song to the game in my opinion and "unsung" is just a wonderful rock song.

"face down" is unfortunately, a repetitive and cacophonous pop-punk junk that the game creators seem to be quite fond of as it was one of the songs that played during the end credits. it comes on so much that i've been forced to memorize the lyrics and that makes me angry. 
also, http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/27/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-rise-of-lady-gaga/.
really really fucking great.

forreals.
love: st. vincent - marrow
hate: can't really think of anything. i don't hear songs i don't like often enough to garner any hatred for them. maybe something off that wavves album everyone's freaking out. i get no-fi n' all, but that's just taking it too far.
also i love day &amp; night by kid cuddy
the rings are cool, but i thought the necklace was kind of ugly... 

the idea though, is awesome
it's about chlamydia, you know.
i like the live version of rare song better. 
i like that idea. how would you like the lyrics shown? inscribed on the inside, or not made implicit at all?
it's about time! i saw her at madison square garden in 2000 when her last album came out. i can't wait to see her again.
favorite: either the wicked messenger by the black keys or white as diamonds by alela diane. 

most hated: the song that goes "i want to ride my bi-cy-cle, i want to ride my bike" because my boyfriend has been torturing me with it for the past month or so. 
[flight of the conchords - too many dicks on the dancefloor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzsmrzkfwzo)
&gt; hate: 95% of what's on mtv and/or the radio. i'm not kidding.

we know.
good friend and i went to puerto vallarta in february and every night we went out and every night we endured at least 3 times per night, pokerface, by lady gaga.  it became the theme song of our trip.  now we always joke that it is our song.
i've been hoping to see her live but i never got a chance. hopefully i can this time!
this isn't a huge offender, but if you had, say, a triforce necklace i wouldn't go around bragging about where it came from.
this is a sade day for music
i would like to read a decent music blog covering acts from the uk, similar to pma. a range of music, but mainly indie. if you know of any good ones, please tell me about them.
as a geeky girl: the bracelet is cool, but i couldn't wear any of these with any delicate fabrics, which sort of makes it a waste because most of the things i'd wear jewelry with are delicate enough to get torn by those. like jeebuswept says, they should offer some with the waveform filled in. i'd wear a black titanium one with white gold or silver inlay, and i'm really not normally into jewelry. 
reminds me of this one i saw on boing boing: http://www.thesoundadviceproject.com/

yes, it's got aimed towards anti-drug parents, but it's a cool idea.
it is personalized. the guy started this out by making engagement rings with "i do" or "will you marry me" wave forms etched into the ring. you would send him a recording of your voice saying either one. i think it was/is only a few grand.

expensive, but not that expensive considered it is an engagement ring.
i remember they had a kids' version where they changed it to "bubblegum trees".
i read this as "said to release new album!"

who's on first?
an ancient technique.  used by the aboes on the didgeridoo.
ah yes, there's the creepy fucking thing i was talking about, for all to see.
favorite: telegraph by orchestral maneuvers in the dark, with the rest of the album almost tying with it.
least favorite: marilyn manson's newest
because it's a nod to anyone else that sees it and understands. for anyone else it's just an odd symbol and would make you seem like a disgusting nerd if you explained.
because playing videogames all day in social isolation is not an attractive or meaningful lifestyle. it's great in moderation (which i have trouble with), but it's nothing to brag about.

this really doesn't apply to the waveform jewelry since those are "artsy" and therefore socially acceptable, but i'm talking about gamer clothing and other stuff to loudly and proudly exclaim our love of basement dwelling.

if you already have friends of similar interests, there's no need to brag about it so that some dude on the street is like, "duuuuude, triforce, nice. i love ocarina of time!" ugh.
obviously i mean the bootlegs, the "official" live version is so sterile and practiced.
one of my friends is really into rap. i have to go on a long car ride with him tomorrow? does anyone know any songs that are in the general genre of rap or hip-hop, but make fun of it? the only song know is "gay fish". i need to piss him off with them...


being a linguistics student, i can tell you that's a no right now. [h] is a strong breathy sound that would make a big wave in the design. [l] would be much more compact. i tried looking around on wiki for more info, but they don't seem to have anything.
[here are some pictures of it.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/61079253@n00/sets/72157619185470087/)
[**i went ahead and made a comparison.**](http://imgur.com/knyuj.jpg)

you're right, the "l" and the "h" are the biggest difference, although i'm surprised at the difference in the "i" and "you" between the two phrases.  i tried to say each in a similar way to be consistent.  oh well.
this song is the greatest. gives me the chills for sure.
love: zero 7 - today

hate: i dunno, something by pink.

in my defense, i don't think zero 7 are that obscure.
don't think that you had something to do with the inconsistency. the proximity of certain sounds with others and how those sounds change each other is actually the heart of phonetics and phonology and those are two of the main linguistic fields. 

it's like how the "t" in "don't" changes dramatically if you say "don't you" vs "don't do that." try it. 
..doesn't seem like it's for sale
holy fuck that song is catchy

that's an awesome idea, more functional than these. like another redditor said, these look like they have sharp edges, but an edison-esque cylinder just makes sense.
i just showed these to my girlfriend.. she said "woooooooah so cool".

i might be in love reddit...
this song is probably in my top five of all time, and the trumpet is a prominent feature.

god damn do i need to get me some stuff from the black keys. already have a pandora station for them.

yes, but if you are the type to buy lots of gamer clothing, generally you have problems with moderation and classify yourself in that lifestyle. i already covered moderation.
i've been really loving the stuff they just put out.

the theme song of halloween isn't all that scary to me anymore (it used to be!), because all i can think of when i hear it now is goldentusk's version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3kli2oyd6i
love: gold splatter by black moth super rainbow.  i think of the movie wall-e every time i hear it.

hate: i don't listen to the radio much any more, but most anything they play on the local hip-hop station.
just felt like sharing a good song and video.

i dig it.
thanks! have started contributing and fixed our subscribe page: http://blog.fixyourmix.com/subscribe/
i somehow got this album *free*... i just went to the page above, clicked the "buy mp3 album with 1click" button, installed amazon's downloader... then it started downloading songs and i got this page.

instead of the rock and blues influences of new danger, the ecstatic is heavily influenced by  middle eastern music. i love "auditorium".
this is too sexy for its shirt. 

its so sexy it hurts. 
i pronounce "don't you" as don chyuu

i thought everyone did that
it's pretty obvious that you don't have an actual point here.
horray!
let me introduce you to my paunch.
dude, urban outfitters has been selling vintage atari and nintendo crap for a de3cade.
everytime my girlfriend and i see that video on the television we look at each other and just say "what the fuck is this 'dance' she is doing?!" when her little face palm hurricane move goes on.
this deserves to be seen by more people than just the music subreddit.
chiptunes forever.
dude, you da man. thanks!

awesome.
i found it on [metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/82185/kick-punch-its-all-in-the-mind), so its probably been seen by lots of redditors already.  i just assume they go there, i don't really know.
hipster crap. also, it's cool to like 8bit, but halo shirts aren't as trendy.
whoa dude, cool your jets. after all, music is just entertainment.
for a skewed idea of what i listen to, my last.fm account is [here](http://www.last.fm/user/ashittyperson).

i have fairly diverse taste, of late i've been listening to a lot of rachel's, godspeed you! black emperor, shellac, mice parade, portishead and film scores (poledouris, morricone, schifrin).

any advice to throw around? thanks.
get happy apple.  you won't be disappointed.
this was really awesome.  you should crosspost this to /r/marijuana for serious you will get jewels :d

voted up because erlend is my nextdoor neighbour! :-)
love mos def. heard this a couple weeks ago and it is really good. definitely worth 3.99.
if you have a free leach just go nuts... my picks. the faint, agoria, soulwax, james zambila... i am more of a dance kid so i am not sure if it is your thing or not. you can also find me on there with the same handle.  
this is a subreddit for letting everyone know about new music that was released, new bands, and anything else about music that's new. ideally this subreddit should be a place where you can find out about new music you never would have come across otherwise.

submissions should be to reviews, writeups, music samples, or music videos. this is not meant to promote your own band, though -- take that to the [we are the music makers subreddit.](http://wearethemusicmakers.reddit.com)
this makes me happy.  thank you!

incorrectly states that a moebius strip can only exist in bi-dimensional pictures.  
i've been saving up for that myself. why didn't you bookmark everything you could think of prior to actually doing it?
to much fighting on the dance floor.
on the mobius strip the ball should have passed over the lower section as well as the upper section because the defining factor of a mobius strip is that it only has one side.
i'm not in the states, so i can't dl it on amazon.  i want to buy it (aka support mos def).  any places i can buy it at this price internationally?  
go harass him until he finally releases the next koc album.
find stuff you like, then buy it.
that is exactly what i was thinking but unsure if i was correct. thanks for the confirmation. 
they are both hanging out in the neighbourhood from time to time, playing guitar in the street, at least it seems they are working on something. i'll tell him the internets asked for a new album and we'll see what he says ;-)
melody, rhythm, harmony, and... bass?
i wish green day could go back to writing songs about poop and masturbation...
huh.  i always thought it was rock a "rhyme".
oh, you total bitch.
is that who did the music?
this is very cool.
i'll probably get downvoted for this, but i really think that $3.99 is a bit *too* cheap for an album, considering the work and inspiration that goes into making one.

thanks for posting this. it's excellent.
if 'quiet dog' is any indication, this should be fantastic:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpmbd5pn54
i dont get it, are you questioning the importance of bass? 
it's pretty obvious that you're full of shit here

edit: dammit i'm going to have to [educate you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hqu8erz-zo).

yes there is such thing as real hiphop, and fake commercial hiphop exists too.
i dont really like this song very much.. the intro is pretty cool on the album but as a single it doesnt work so well..
take a strip of paper, make a loop, break loop and twist one end one half rotation, reconnect loop.

my dad used to do this in restaurants to impress me. never ceased to amaze himself.

i agree. i saw that cds were $10, and thought that was a fair price. then i saw $3.99 on amazon and thought "great!" then i downloaded and somehow got a $3.99 discount off $3.99... and i feel like i torrented the album. i guess i'll just have to see mos def in concert to make up for it.
didn't know mos had a new album out.  thanks for the heads up!
i pirated this a few days ago and absolutely loved it. his best album since his debut. totally worth the $4. 
if you really want to support him, buy merchandise or go to a show.  he probably doesn't get a very big cut from album sales anyway.

mix was good, though.
well, they better hurry up because they going to be pretty far back in that line.
they totally didn't though. if you check the image i posted, they gave me a $3.99 discount for some reason. it shows in my order history that it was $3.99 and -$3.99 so total is $0.00.
great song, especially when played live. when i saw the reformed specials (minus terry hall and jerry dammers) in 1996, the way it sounded was just amazing, i'll never forget it.
why must the youth fight against themselves?
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

great album, but i think i'll need more listens to make a fair comparison with 'black on both  sides' (which i consider to amongst the all time great hip-hop albums). 

mos also did a track with dj deckstream recently. unfortunately it's not on the album, but on deckstream's new mixtape. for those of you who are curious, have a listen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu5uvplvgck)
i've painstakingly tried to explain to my ex how there is only one side to a moebius strip. i did the paper strip thing, i even drew a line on the strip without lifting my pencil. she didn't accept/believe/understand it.
wow. you have some daddy issues you want to talk about?
this album *sucks*.  it's un-listenable crapola.

how can 4 (okay, 3) accomplished musicians make such garbage? especially joe satriani! i have every one of his albums, and i enjoy most, if not all, of them.
odd.  did you previously get an mp3 download credit for buying something or other?  i've gotten those before, and i think they just auto-apply when you buy mp3s in the future.
nope, i had never used the mp3 download option before.
&gt; because gm doesn't have enough problems

is that pity?  is that fucking pity right there?  yeah, gm is the victim for being in its current situation.

a percussionist who used to work for wb once judged our juries [performance exams for music majors] when i was still in school. he talked about how hard the xylophone parts were, especially in this show and *freakazoid.* after listening to this again, i can agree that the people who wrote this stuff were crazy/amazing musicians.
you may be right, but i will be buying this when i get home... and i probably wouldn't have otherwise.
does anyone know if madlib is involved in this album? several loops sound like his or dilla's and there is a style that sounds like his or his brother oh no...
i really like the sound this guy has. i'm a huge wes anderson/jason schwartzman/coconut records fan and for some reason this guy reminds me of all that. its like that type of music with an electronica layer added. love it!
you've probably seen a bumper sticker that says "kill your television!"

don't bother.

corporate dominated television and radio are busy killing themselves.
this is no longer true. it is now officially m-g-m-t.

enjoy!
did anyone else notice that animaniacs recognizes palestine's sovereignty?  we could all learn a lesson.

or something.
well, gm certainly made some poor business decisions over the past decade, but to think they would be in this shape absent the banking crisis (which they had little to nothing to do with) takes some very interesting logic.
i could see how the lyrics make you think of those people but the actual music in the background definitely has alot of electronica thrown in. but like i said...i still see your point because i havent heard much music that will put a synthesizer and an acoustic guitar all together but this guy does.
and it's all due to internet use and/or piracy. it has nothing to do with the quality of content being distributed.

see: john and kate plus 8, jonas brothers, etc.
yeah, but you have to remember that there's no packaging and no shipping charges, which could easily make up that  six bucks.  especially if there's no major label dickwads involved, so he might actually get paid. 

i'm buying this no question.  i heard the single a couple weeks ago and it was really good.   
a bunch of 50 - 65 year old men telling me what i want to listen to and watch is ridiculous.
a sound file showing what it does would be useful.
most of the budgets for the major labels go to marketing and a&amp;r. you cut the salaries for all the useless suits out of the equation, and the costs drop significantly.
and under appreciated. they certainly earned their paychecks
&gt;i pirated this...totally worth the $4.

at this point all i can do is suggest you stfu.
and they use the weird spelling “isreal”!  there might be a hidden political agenda behind this clip.
that's a decent track. i think ["lifetime"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsy4n0s-tik) is one of the best songs he's put out in a while. he does a great live show though. anyway, i have some business to take care of at amazon right now. hopefully he'll get enough of a sales bump in the next few days for people to take some notice.

something else.  like the fact that everything sounds the same and major record labels are much less willing to take chances on unique new sounds.
you must not be aware that gm felt that selling 9 out of 10 models at a loss was a good way of doing business... or that they invented the concept of planned obsolescence.

honda would never sell a product at a loss.  if they took a product all the way through r&amp;d and were ready to begin production, only to find that they couldnt compete, they'd scrap the model... as they have done many times.

also... theres this small company you may have heard of... name of gmac... they were a top holder of toxic assets and therfor quite directly involved.

gm is not a victim of anything other than their own short sightedness.
i wish he pronounced it soo-dahn at the end there.  just for the rhyme.
i'm in my early 30s right now. turning 33 in june. i use to think that part of the reason i don't like these new bands was because i was getting older. then i realized, that it's not it at all. it's that the music i am hearing now, is being pushed on me by old fucks who believe these bands are "p cool dawg!". they're shitty musicians, being directed by shitty producers, and shitty sound engineers.
a good example would be metallicas' latest album "death magnet". a lot of metal guys praise this album. i don't. i probably would have, but i don't, mainly because it's unlistenable. literally. they mixed it so poorly over amplifying everything to the point that i can't even enjoy listening to one chord, because it actually sounds tooo distorted... 

or maybe i'm just an old fuck now. who fucking knows. bah!
madlib is producing the beats, and it sounds lovely.
piracy is killing the music industry like the economic downturn is killing american car companies.  

"people aren't buying their cars because of the economy!  it *can't* be a problem with the product!"
notice that much of the major label rock releases of the past season have been half-baked money grabs from 90's bands? 311, blink 182, smashing pumpkins, the offspring, guns n roses, stp, weezer, pusa, green day, blah blah. the only good one was friggin' depeche mode and they're even older.

half the time when i listen to the radio i wind up on top 40 stations, because i would much rather listen to katy perry or akon (or even the black eyed peas) than friggin' velvet revolver or some other cliche abomination.

and im a dyed in the wool rock musician

other politically significant choices:

-the sovereignty of tibet &amp; taiwan

-burma, as opposed to myanmar

-czechoslovakia, as opposed to an independent czech republic and slovakia

-a united north and south korea

-no mention of the former soviet nations, aside from russia

-still recognizes a unified yugoslavia

-no mention of south africa (possibly in protest of apartheid)

yakko had quite the political agenda. i never realized.

it was more sarcasm that wasn't readily apparent.
in that case, didn't you mean:

ftfy
partly. we constantly got into arguments over the most insignificant things. she got mad at me for trying to explain this as well. but mostly because of irreconcilable differences.
or maybe it was just easier to rhyme specific things and difficult to rhyme other things so they were changed/left out
nuh uh, ain't no trees in botswana, nuh uh, i know, i am a botswanian lumberjack, and i ain't never had a job... 
i, for one, want to listen to music and watch television/movies that the creativity hasn't been focus-grouped out of.

ah, thank goodness the w3c has approved the &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag for html 5 then... i can't wait!

;)
no i meant it how i wrote it. i grasped the concept the first time he did it. i think every other time he was just doing it for himself. hence the 'never ceased to amaze himself.' 

thanks for playing though. did you have fun?
weird, i just watched this on dvd last night, hadn't seen it since i was a kid.
submitted upon request from a reddit user.  people underestimate the significance of their music.  if you never understood why the beatles were such great composers, check this video out.
well yeah, but by that logic, i just wasted a good amount of time looking up and over analyzing the lyrics to a song from a children's television show when i should have been getting work done.
i'm in my late 30s, and agree wholeheartedly.

which probably means you are indeed an old fuck. :)

really, though:  i think the unholy trinity of clear channel, ticketmaster and autotune is what's pounding the final nails in the coffin here.

that and the fact that music nowadays is utter *shit*.  everyone in the band plays the same notes.  where's the harmonizing?  where are the guitar solos?

and don't get me started on the angsty, whining vocals.  wanna see a post get dowmodded to hell?  here we go:

green day.  smashing pumpkins.  et al.

if i want to listen to that kind of thing, i can go to the local mall and get the same effect from overhearing 14-year old girls chattering endlessly into their cell phones.
i thought this song was from 93, but i might be wrong there. in that case, czechoslovakia was still one nation, but yugoslavia had already started to break apart in june of 1991, but had not fully dissolved yet. so he would have just been missing a couple of newly independent nations.
i once watched in arabic and of course wakko said palestine not israel, at the time i thought how cool it would be if it was originally like this.

and now i find out they really included palestine, it makes me so happy, i love animaniacs!!
people will. they could sell the album for a dollar and people would still go pirate it. some people have convinced themselves they shouldn't have to pay for music because they are too awesome. and of course, because of them, those of us who do pay for music end up having to pay more.

at least amazon does stuff like this all the time. most big releases you can download for around $5 the day they come out, and when there isn't something new out you can pick up a solid album by a lesser known bad for a couple of dollars. couple that with their monthly collection of $5 albums and i can't see how anyone would choose to use itunes. 
both yemens?  i thought yemen was unified by the time this show aired?
easy on the sound engineers, they know what sounds good but they're being hamstrung by a&amp;r fucks and corporate expectations.
he's tapping out morse code for "help i'm stuck in a fish tank!"
protip: you can get a similar collection of songs for free of amazon and don't have to subjugate yourself to a horrendous website design. 
how does any of this contradict my statement?  also, i believe it was the creation of the toxic assets and their erroneous rating as triple-a that was the major _source_ of the problem, not the fact that they were purchased.
taiwan is also fairly significant; especially considering they didn't mention south/north korea separately.
i can't be completely sure, but i think the design was on purpose.  a couple of clicks and you're outta there.  unless you want to look at their [*regular* site](http://www.subpop.com/).
i did, that stuff was done downloading within an hour or two. grabbed about 65 records that way haha.
that's a great track. i just listened to it 3 times. damn.
it's a great music tracker.
so are you going to buy it now?
no.

well, if the record in question has been pressed on vinyl, and i really love it... maybe.

i haven't bothered with cds since i first got a broadband connection.
the problem, sir, is with your lack of appropriate big-media conditioning. [/s]

i went to a music focus group (or, lied and said i listened to the radio to get $50), they were shoveling the same tired songs to radio listeners for survey responses, as if the opinions mattered. what mattered was whether the station could keep a large enough audience with their current tired songs, or needed to change it up with some different tired songs.

i think it's getting harder for media companies to dictate peoples' tastes to them, a process hastened ironically by media consolidation ("every station sounds the same"), and happily aided by the web.
so amazing..
this site is really cool - you can add and edit everything on there as well as track bands, venues, cities, and friends.
i am [iheartmusic](http://songkick.com/users/iheartmusic) on there - track me + i'll track you back!
was it not clear that i have since bought it? the timeline was: 

i pirated. 
i dug.
i bought for $4. 

see how that works? 

at this point all i can do is suggest you stfu.
i already bought it. that was what i was trying to get a across. i pirate things to check 'em out and if i like 'em, i buy 'em. it's simple. 
point taken. i added it to the list.
your error is your belief that professional financiers (at the highest executive level) bear no responsibility in vetting the soundness of their investments, and should be forgiven for relying on the most generic and broad definitions of financial soundness.

how is it that a simple medical doctor turned congressman saw and warned of exactly this issue for nearly a decade while so many (but by no means all) the financiers continued to drink the kool-aid?

hell, i'm just a lowly i.t. peon and even i, with my limited financial knowledge, clearly understood the warnings given years ago.

and beyond the involvment in toxic assets, your statement:

&gt;but to think they would be in this shape absent the banking crisis (which they had little to nothing to do with) takes some very interesting logic.

...shows that you were unaware that gm has been flirting with financial disaster since the 70's, and has not been able to compete in global or local markets in at least as long.  rather than improve their products and business practices, gm became a marketing and investment firm that also happened to sell (poorly engineered, with a few exceptions) cars.
&gt; spanish sahara is gone

also mentions transylvania and crete
yeah, i loved that one too!  it was incredible.
there is a lot of crap on there.  you just have to keep clicking next until you find something you like.  i only enjoy about half of the songs i see on there.  
hell, so am i.  just have ears, is all...

the really ironic part is that my real name rhymes with the subbie's username.  oh shit, am i seeing patterns where there are none?  someone call ron howard!
i came across this album last week by a friends request.  i found the album to be completely delightful from beginning to end...every song is great, the guitars are amazing, the dealing guitars adds a cool atmosphere.

i could go on for days, what do you guys think?
thanks. thought so much when i did not find anything about it on google that wasn't about waffles.
they were making record profits all through the 90's and well into the early part of the decade.  they wouldn't be immensely profitable now regardless of external events, but they would at least be a functioning company.  yes, a great deal of their profit came through financing, but the loans they gave out were not toxic in the same way that mortgages have been;  i.e. they wanted people to pay them back.  i still see no great arguments that gm would have failed regardless of external events.

also, enough with the fucking ron paul worship, it really doesn't add anything to your point.
gonna have to disagree there.
i agree, today's hard rock is as generic as it gets
he mentions puerto rico, too, though it's part of the u.s. can't immigrate from p.r.
animaniacs &amp; [histeria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/histeria!) were awesome shows!

i remember after taking a history test in highschool i watched an episode of histeria. they answered almost every question that was on the test. it's like they did the whole episode around the highschool level curriculum. histeria had a charm of making information stick to it's viewers too. 
i would much rather turn the radio off than listen to katy perry, akon, black eyed peas or velvet revolver.
&gt;yes, a great deal of their profit came through financing

record profits as compared to... toyota?

this underscores my original point that gm has run their business solely for immediate gains with no acknowledgment of risks to their long term viability.

it's as if i proposed to you that if you invested 10,000 with my investment firm, i could net you a yield of 30% next quarter... way above market performance.  this may sound like a deal too good to pass up, you'd get 3,000 in the first quarter alone!!  but in the second quarter my highly risky investment practices would fail completely, resulting in a total loss for you... so you invested 10k, recieved 3k in profit, then lost 10k.  your net yield is -7k.  would you pat yourself on the back for making record profits in the first quarter?
p.s.... 

who's ron paul?
i'm not sure exactly what you're arguing with me about, but it certainly isn't over my main point.  

&gt;who's ron paul

cute.
at this point i'm just trolling i guess... my work can be so boring sometimes.

i think it had something to do with sympathy toward gm's position, as if they had no hand in their current predicament.
i'm not in the my early 30s (actually 10 years younger) and i agree wholeheartedly. i am also a fresh out of school musician so i have a bias but am also interested in the business side of these things.

i cannot stress for you how much i hope, and pray (even though i don't believe in god) that the major record labels totally collapse. it's already happening with many of them conceding within each other and buying up "major" indie labels (because indie labels actually make money, considering they don't take 95% of the artists profit).

like you guys above me have stated, it's over produced garbage that all sounds the same. it only takes so long for the listener and people with an ounce of intelligence to be totally lost on it after a couple of seconds, minutes, or even full plays through a track.

major business is all the same. major label music reached it's peak. the suing that these labels are doing are them grabbing on by the only hand they have left. for some reason, they think it's okay to keep doing the same thing like overspending for an artist, spending far too much (private jets, parties, corporate credit cards with no limit, really?), and paying middle-men far too much.

ultimately, i really hope it all ends for the major labels. while they have provided us with amazing technology, the shit regurgitated over and over again is out of control.
i loved good idea, bad idea. it really cracked me up back in '95

hey my brother can sing this song.
touche, sir. your logic stands.
no northern ireland, but mentions england and scotland.  kampuchea vs. cambodia. no brunei or singapore either.
don't feel bad, you guys. i'm 19 and i avoid the modern music scene. but there is something that has to be said, though: 

rock is dead. 

we can replay the classics, or we can remake them, but modern rock is dead. it's no longer creative as an artform, and the only reason we keep seeing new rock music is because it's commercially viable. let's admit the truth and move on. 

this is why music sales are declining. the music the major record labels is selling is no longer worth buying, but not because it's bad, but simply because it's the same music as a few decades ago, repackaged with some new face leading the band. 

record labels used to be led by people who were ahead of the curve and knew a musical trend before anyone else. now they are led by the same people, but their ear for modern music has been dulled. 
"and of course, because of them, those of us who do pay for music end up having to pay more."

i disagree. i say those entitled crapholes would do without if it was unavailable for free. that's not a lost sale, and certainly not lost income.
that has been one of my favorite albums for years.
no it wasn't clear at all. sorry about your butthurt, though.
he's fucking one of a kind, isn't he? i mean, he might talk some wingnut conspiracy shit on bill maher, but i think he's still one of the premier entertainers we have with us today.
[wiki entry on the album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_ecstatic)

[all music review](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:wxfexztkldae~t1) confirms that madlib provided loops from his [beat konducta series](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hnfoxzegld0e)
word.
it at least lets the music companies try and justify their prices, as obviously its impossible to tell what percentage of piracy would've resulted in music sales, (and what percentage of music sales were generated due to piracy)
or listen to local talk radio or npr.
d'angelo's entire brown sugar album. i know, it's d'angelo, but that album is smooth as fuck. [samples here](http://www.amazon.com/brown-sugar-dangelo/dp/b000002twn)

i would also add to that anything by julie london or bobby darin while in his swing "phase".
everyone knows what the 'something else' is, including the music industry. kids today also spend their money on ring tones, computer games, consoles, mmorpg goods, i could go on for hours listing new things that are taking money away from music.

face it; for the price of a cd you can generally buy two dvds. that's just retarded value for money. 
*let's stay together* by al green.
are you pondering what i'm pondering?
d'angelo...fuck yeah
i personally like closer to you by the wallflowers
hey, leave 311 out of this.
damn those wikipedia no fun police.  because of that article i just learned that i've been pronouncing the capital of vermont wrong for years after first hearing it on wakko's america.
i found it interesting that he used the term kampuchea in place of cambodia..  that was the name pol pot gave to the country: republic of kampuchea.  i always thought it was kind of backwards and inappropriate to refer to cambodians as kampucheans.
uh, i think so, debton, but burlap chafes me so.
hmmm... i have put thought into it, the truth is that there has been this level of quality in music since i was a kid (i'm 34). remember warrant? skid row? poison? i listen to songs that were popular at the time and i cringe at the music and lyrics. they are transparent in their pandering to horny teenagers. 

this has been true since popular music became an industry. elvis was just as culpable. now it's just cheaper and the ability to target specific demographics is much more refined. they create little cults of personality that people who are casting about for identity can latch onto. i was a 'buttrocker' when i was younger, because i wanted to fit in. as soon as i started listening to the college station, though, it was all over.
good point. i believe the same idea is true of referring to burma as myanmar. interesting that he goes with burma and yet also kampuchea. 
[d'angelo - untitled (how does it feel)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ulzuck_fgo) is a good one.

[zero 7 - distractions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqz7juhqr-c) another great one.

[massive attack - black milk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4va9etqma30) i like this one for when things start getting heavy.
i think it's unfair to say that rock is dead and that there can be no creativity in it. that would be like saying that electronic dance music is dead because it's all four-on-the-floor beats with latched arps. or that hip hop is dead due to the excessive use of autotune and trite, boastful lyrics.

the majority of any genre of music is always going to be uninspired hash.

but if by modern rock, you mean the insipid post-grunge and pop-punk-emo/whatever they're marketing it as now.. that rapes my ears every time i turn on the radio, then i'll agree. that music is like the movie-based video games that they rush to market as if it were a promotional lunchbox.
uh, i think so, debton, but what if the chicken won't wear the nylons? 
did you preview before purchasing?  or maybe even torrent, then purchase?

regarding chickenfoot, i saw them the other night (i think on letterman)...wow, some garbage.
ok fine, i don't mean to say there aren't pockets of creativity in rock today. i will, however, say that it's really, really rare to find something like that. 

i'll refine the point. electronic music is still an emerging genre. it is still developing and finding influences. rap, i must say, has somewhat stagnated, but there are still some popular acts that do something new. rock, on the other hand, has been *done to death.* just saying this dooms me to be corrected sooner or later, but i see no place where rock can go at this point. it's exhausted its potential and is now coasting on nostalgia and money. 
while the author is being snarky, he fails to mention that the chart is not made up of only sales to the young, who are buying games. the chart includes sales to people of all ages.
throw on a thievery corporation album, and you're guaranteed a good time.  even if things go pear-shaped.
ah, well in that case i retract my previous jab at your comment. have an internet.
my initial guess is no.  my experience is that if you want flac, you a) rip a cd, b) download the torrent, c) hope the band is kind enough to offer flac on their site.
no.

they aren't now, and they haven't been any other time in the last six years or so that they've been asking this question.

the point of asking the question over and over again, is to keep people connecting the two (even if the articles keep saying "no.")

rock isn't an overdone genre.  it is mainly branching off into other genres while still incorporating rock aspects.  if you want traditional rock, there's the white stripes, the hives, art brut, arctic monkeys; hell, even 90s alt rock is making a comeback with dinosaur jr. and pixies getting back together. 

 post rock bands like explosions in the sky and mono are taking traditional rock concepts and stretching them out into pure masterpieces.  

coheed and cambria are a perfect example of a popular metal band that's both technically good and commercially successful.  much less, bands like dream theater which are still going strong with fans.

then of course there are the experimental rock bands like the immensely successful radiohead, that are pioneering and redifining genres as we now it.  you can't say that rock is dead.  all the bands i've listed are generally well-known and are doing pretty well for themselves.  no matter what, good content will live on and i have a feeling that once all is said and done, the most successful labels will be the ones that listened to the fans and the artists in the first place and produced music solely for the love of it.
i want flac so i can download instead of buying a cd. i doubt the kind of music i listen to is available as flac on bittorrent.
i'll be honest and say that i enjoy black eyed peas.  they may work with the industry, but they're pretty original and definitely catchy and fun.

plus their side projects are pretty cool - the sergio mendez tribute album is way fun.
oh, i was thinking of something more along the lines of "requiem for a dream"
top it? maybe not... but it's a very high bar to compare it to.

i'm a fan of [pogo](http://www.last.fm/music/pogo), he's got quite a few very charming tunes...
that...and hellllloooooooooooooooooooo nurse!!
what kind of music are you looking for?  
deathclock is always romantic
it's cus hagar the horrible is on it
the way i see it, there has never been a better time to listen to music than right now.  the crap they churn out on the radio only makes you search for something else, and that something else is readily available for anyone motivated enough to look for it.  i've reached this stage, and by finding valuable music blogs and mining the shit out of them, i've struck musical gold.  i can honestly tell you that what i listen to now is what i'll listen to forever.
everyone knows chicken boo was the best segment on animaniacs.
did anyone else notice that israel was spelled isreal? anyone know if that is an accepted alternative spelling or whether it was simply a mistake?
wales and northern ireland are not mentioned either.
anything by barry white and love unlimited.
for anyone interested, major lazer is comprised of djs diplo and switch.  you may remember them from the mia song "paper planes".  very excited for the album coming out this month!

it should be noted that major lazer is a jamaican commando who lost his arm in a secret zombie war in 1984. then the u.s. military equipped him with experimental lasers that double as prosthetic limbs. he supposedly fights vampires and various monsters, parties hard, and has a rocket powered skateboard.

edit the whole album is now streaming off the duos myspace: http://www.myspace.com/majorlazer

good song, but the guitar and singer are out of tune in this performance.
question for the americans: was learning the state capitols really important? i ask innocently because it is something often referred to in american tv shows. i can't think of any equivalent here in scotland (or the uk as a whole) and wonder if there is any other reason than basic geography. 
this reminds me of a rant i spilled when a few weeks ago, someone asked me what i might say to representatives of today's music industry if i got the chance.  it's not great, but it's relevant, so here it is:

 you want to know what's wrong with the music business?  you've compromised.  you've played it safe.  you’ve given the middle finger to creativity.  think about the list of 60s and 70s hit artists.  some of the talent on that list could melt my hands off.  but today?  “a thirty-second guitar solo?  no, that's too radical.  it’s not palatable, so we don't want to risk it.  nickelback will do just fine.  a haunting song with a slow and subtle melody?  it might have worked with the great singers of yesterday, but no, people don't have the patience anymore.”  try us.  i’m not saying it has to be the same manifestations of creativity as the great artists of past decades gave us, but give us something.

but no, you won’t.  so katy perry's "hot and cold" permeates the airwaves and hits number one on the charts.  it's got a catchy beat and a catchy tune, and damnit, that's good enough.  these songs are easy to churn out, and a few will catch on here or there, and that'll keep the money coming in.

nothing on the radio floors us anymore.  nothing wows us.  nothing gives us chills as we hear it for the first time.  nothing gives us a sense of fulfillment and appreciation for what we've just experienced.  albums from today's pop radio stars aren't going to be stamped in the halls of greatness.  just because michael jackson and madonna did something huge with a genre (and i think they did it well) doesn't mean the next 20 years have to follow it.   you're killing record sales with your shameless compromises, with your lack of guts, with your refusal to take a chance or give the world something that's slightly jarring.  

and what's sad is, since you're filling the airwaves and hit charts with this hollow uninspired drivel, you're stifling creative potential everywhere.  less and less kids are being exposed to quality music, so less and less kids are inspired to make their own music.  

of course, there's a boatload of talent and creativity in music today.  it's in the underground scenes of a vast multitude of genres and cross-genres.  it's in the youtube clips of a 16-year-old boy playing some song he wrote with the guitar, as unpolished as it may be, and on the website of the college kid who studies during the day, and cuts mixes and beats at night.  you're behind the times, lost in a sea of compromise and safe choices, without the light of creativity to show you the way.  well, there are folks out there with a sense of what music is about, and yeah, they're starting to abandon you.

here's a piece of advice meant for our children, for our friends, for bill o'reilly, and for you guys.  you know when you relentlessly blame someone for doing something wrong?  usually, when you find yourself doing that, it helps to stop and take a look in the mirror, because chances are, if you look hard enough, you'll see the problem in there.  so as you continue your crusade to attack us for "killing the music industry," stop for a second and consider examining what the music industry has become.  what i see is a beast clinging desperately to a mode of existence that’s (hopefully) becoming less and less fitting.  i hope you wear out your welcome.

http://nugs.net/

bootlegs only though.. no album style downloads. if you like the smashing pumpkins, check out the many shows they have from their last tour for sale.. 
to be fair, they don't really say the word "rhyme."  they say, "rock-uh-rahm."

other lyrics i've screwed up because the singers have marbles in their mouths...

manfred mann "blinded by the light... wrapped up like a douche...."

and... 

jimi hendrix "s'cuse me while i kiss this guy..."


apathy is what is killing the music business. 
correlation =/= causation.

i'm all for hating on the music industry, but come on, reddit, you know better than that.
stephen marley with snoop and slightly stoopid?? that's unreal!
if you get your music from the radio you're not worthy of anything better. i'm 20 and pretty much despise most of the new music, but there are so many older and less known bands that i don't have the need to have a good popular band all of the time, only twice a year.
yeah i have those. i think there are five actually, four and a best of. anyway, thanks for the suggestion.

if you like those you might want to check out the dusty fingers series. perhaps i should put together a page of recommended compilation albums. do you think that would be a good idea?

edit: typos and added a bit more info
lack of desirable product
uh, i think so, debton, but where are we going to find rubber pants at this hour?
i guess so.  i'm a big fan of all sorts of music.  i just purchased the mp3 album of huun huur tu yesterday.  they're so indie that they're still fucking indigenous.

but i guess i can't be cool (fuck hipsters!) and like both them and the black eyed peas.
i remember when it came out and i didn't really give it a chance back then, i just revisited it about a month ago as a download and it is amazing. 
i do love me some killers
my favorite thing is that dance he does in every vocal break. he looks so charmingly psychotic.
television is amazing. i was quite addicted to them for a couple months.
since the late 90s rock, rap, and pop music have all started sounding the same with less and less inspiring lyrics and attention to the music itself.

i suppose their plan is that if everything sounds like shit sooner or later people wont be able to tell the difference.
i think that i speak for a lot of us when i say that we've been waiting for descent music since the early 90s.
15 years ago my little girl, 5 at the time, put an animaniacs sticker on my guitar case. at first i was like, oh man, this will really go over well when i drag my gear into a club for a gig, or at a party...then i realized it was pure genius. the sticker is still there.
edit: spelling, yakko is gonna be pissed.
dude, come on.  if the music sucks and nobody wants to buy it, let them trash it.

don't start a pledge drive to get money for shit nobody wants.
did you learn the capitals of other european countries? i guess that's the closest you could have over there.

also, the word you're looking for is capital. capitol refers to the actual government building in the capital. (confusing, right?)
bleep used to sell flac, maybe they still do with some stuff, but now i noticed they sell wav which is much better.
the use of autotune has greatly slowed my music buying habits. i find myself listening to cd's i haven't played in a while and really getting into them again because music now its such crap. anytime i turn on the radio it's song after song of autotuned unlistenable bullshit.
i think the increase in an aging population has also had an effect on the music industry. they're not buying, because it's just recycled crap with auto voice and a simple beat behind it.
piracy is not killing the music industry, shit music is.

fortunately there are a plethora of ridiculously good musicians out there who manage to get by on indie labels or a 'recording studio' in their basement or garage.  

people now have myspace, purevolume, music-map, tons of music blogs, word of mouth...  there are so many new ways to find new artists and acquire their music that the radio and television are no longer the front lines of the music scene.

radio is dead, at least for real music fans.
i'd like to share one of my favorite bands with you, reddit.  they are bowerbirds and from north carolina and they are simply amazing.
lack of talent.
its been blindingly obvious for ten years or more, that the 15-25 age group are not buying music cds, they are spending their disposables on gaming. the music industry is pissed off that their market share is stagnant and not increasing like all the other segments.

too bad, so sad. maybe they could promote and sell music that people actually want, not rehashed decades old crap, and cloned teeny bands.

tv is overdosing the viewer with wall to wall fancy sound and music effects, music does not have the market or social value it once had before. years ago tv was more sedate and not 'in your face' with deafening audio, music was a choice when you played a record, now people escape from sound.

the record companies and assorted big corps are also in the business of so called giving away 'free' mp3 tracks with purchases of soda and other crap, what value music when its seen as a disposable promotional gift.

it must be disheartening for serious musicians to see their art degraded this way.

at least people who gather p2p music are collectors of a sort, they like music enough to go through the hassle and effort to hoard and catalog gbs of audio to maybe listen to, but also collect in a nerdish stamp collector way. they are the true audiophiles.
yeah, just his lyrics and flow alone is off the hook. in a world with soulja boy's and 50 cent's, we need people like mos, talib kweli, the roots etc.
music mastered in an obnoxious loudness way, wall to wall audio mush.
to a degree music is dead, classic rock stations play music from 20 to 40-50 years ago, and its sounds as good as or better than anything that is around today, which really effectively means the promoted bands are living in the past or do not know what to do, except plagiarize the past.

with the 'deconstruction' archaeological software the music biz has at its disposal today, they can remake old records into new, theres been many a new record from the last decade that has serious undertones of old famous music buried in its melodies, even stolen pink floyd undertones are noticeable on a couple of recent songs, and they were not pf songs or connected to them in any way, except the ripoff of their structure or melodies.
tone deaf carenot 50 - 65 year old men...
they hope to buy up indie labels, as happened in previous decades, but alas interweb is here, people in indie music are networked, sharing info and well aware of the rip off contracts and bad practices, who would sign up and get screwed these days.
2,3 or 4 dvds for the price of a music album.
its an aging, and very young demographic which buys cds, that and the really poor people sans pcs...
what sort of bullshit fucking viral shit is this? no one gives a fuck about them. fuck off.
but we have m&amp;m, just a shame the voice changes on almost every song he records...

and you cant convince me a middle class white boy has the voice of several different black singer(s).

came to this conclusion by watching several youtube m&amp;m videos of m&amp;m songs.
uh, i think so, debton, but do they even make  elephant suits in our size?
and too many record company exec's kids being promoted as the next new thing.
the death of the traditional music industry is a wonderful thing for both musicians and the audience.  

musicians don't have to worry about getting signed, and can instead concentrate on producing great music that connects them with their audience.  no need for an intermediate anymore.  i say bring it...


 
closer by nin is far more romantic..
killers rock still
not a pledge drive, you receive some merch.  i consider it recapitalization.  and you fuckin deserved the downmod i gave you for not recognizing a decent way to crowd source investment.  
there's a really good recording of a similar version (acoustic with georgia singing - may actually be the same performance, just off the pa) on the prisoners of love anthology if you get the 3 disc set with the rarities disc (or just get it off tpb of course).
so... who else read to the end looking for some sign of being bel aire'd?
god dammit you're cool.
does it make you feel dirty submitting things like this?
downmod and move along folks.
the music doesn't suck and people clearly want to buy it.  they met their goal of $1000 on the first day.  come on guys, don't let thousands of great albums go in a landfill.
this is one of my favorite parts about this album; you can tell that mos listened to beat konducta and just started rapping over the top and after some production it turned into some of these tracks.
same goes for guam which is mentioned.
ya, john mentions that at the end.


still, i think it's a good performance. it's cool to hear an acoustic version of this song. 

[edit: should have posted this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9syjvl5jsq) 
this is narrated by howard goodall. he's done a lot of composing for tv and so forth. redditors might recognize his work as he composed the excellent red dwarf theme as well as the music for blackadder.
i hate yakko.
ok, you explain what i'm missing here.

honestly, i was being kinda sarcastic before, but now i think that sending those albums to a landfill is what must be done for the sake of humanity.

[edit] motherfuckers, if you're going to downvote, at least have the decency to post some links to polyvinyl tracks that don't suck donkey balls.

i'm wet.
and you deserve the downmod i gave you for promoting a shitty investment.
nice!
check out my friend "sievert," aspiring chiptunes artist, he is pretty good.

and i am not too computer savvy so if someone would remind me how to embed a link i would not look dumb next time i want to post one, thanks.
yes!  i used to love both of those segments.


well, deconstruction has its upsides. consider what is being done in the indie genre. they basically tear down the entire edifice of rock and mix it with dance to create a sort of awesomely rhythmic, simple, yet effective style. 

i do not consider this rock, because it has migrated so far away from what can be considered pure rock to be its own genre. 
way to go dude. let this be a lesson. 
er, thanks, but, i'm not.
who are you - the who
best love song ever
i still have the animaniacs tape with this song on it from way back.
go get some richard hell and the voidoids, listen to that, and try to fathom what marquee moon would have sounded like if television didn't kick hell out of the band.
because they're twice as big, for the same price!

(a b-side so find it on hypemachine or sth)
enjoy ;)
maxwell: embrya - the whole album. trust me.
if i had the choice between my nuts and being able to play like that... well, i'd have to think long and hard.
yeah why support stuff you like? that's just dumb.

i can see maybe not wanting to support certain labels, but such a blanket statement is pure ignorance and disrespect for the people that create the art you appreciate.

and get off your retarded high horse.  what's the difference between downloading something mastered for cd and buying a cd other than not supporting the people that make the things you enjoy?  you probably post in every thread concerning television about how you don't own a tv, also, don't you?
i take offense to the fact that he left out the great baltics.

not really.  but i am 50% lithuanian.
i met you in the right moment

i met you in the right way

you took a pause and looked.

then you couldnt lok away

out of fear i held my tongue

out of fear i stayed in silence

you did all the talking

that night i stayed in silence

because i thought

that a word from my tongue

could be the very thing

that would make you run

run, run away from me

oh how, how silly could i be



 if only for a moment

would i have turned the right way

you would have heard and looked

and i would take you breath away

because i threw the thought 

and bit my toungue

said all the things

and waited for you to run

but instead you came to me

and how, how happy could i be

how happy, could, i be

different song (if you didnt get that form the line)

thats cool

and im a fool

i dont know what youre thinking

thats great

i hide my face

i dont know whati was thinking



lifes a beach 

so go swim around

i take you back home

you roll the ball 

through the yard

and youll take me home



and all i know

i want to know

is where i am

and where i stand

my thoughts escape 

the words that make

the noise i take

to say what i need to say

there is no way

too far ive strayed

for all humanity

i need i need

to stop and just think clearly



nothing makes sense anymore

lifs such a bore

and i just ignore

the thoughts inside

the ones that drive

confusion i find

this confusion i

through glass doors

through the doors

all i have is to ignore

just ignore



but why must i

stop and sigh

about this life

i just confuse it more




while what you are saying seems to make sense, it is not based on empirical evidence, unless you have that evidence and have not supplied it.

but wait, does it make sense? in the article, the author pulls out this data "at least 7 million people in britain use illegal downloads".

let's find out how many brits there are aged say 15-35. as of mid 2005, there were 13.3 million males and females. when you go to the link, read down until you find "t-04". it will provide an excel table that provides the numbers.

http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nscl.asp?id=7562&amp;pos=1&amp;colrank=1&amp;rank=144

so you think 7 million of the 13.3 million men and women (60 million total brits) are doing all the illegal downloading? that's only 52% of that age range. 7 million is also only 4.2% of total brits.

i'm not sure i buy your theory.

edit: changed purchasing to illegal downloading.

that isn't overwhelming evidence that only the aging and very young buy cd's, not when half of your favored age range are not downloading illegally.
retrovertigo is such a great song. i don't know why, but i always imagine david bowie singing it.
of course i own a television, what the hell else am i going to watch baseball on?

support things i like? i played in bands for ten years and change... i've learned that i don't much care for record labels; why should i support them? the bands can take my support when i pay to see them and buy merch directly from them at shows.

i don't feel any need to get into a piracy debate beyond this. my logic for downloading music is that i'd rather go that route than pay for stuff. you can preach morality at me over the internet all you want... you have about as great a chance of changing my mind as i do of changing yours.

so anyway, feel free to get off *your* high horse.
uh, i think so, debton, but me and pippi longstocking? i mean, what would the children look like?
i've been recording music at home for years, but have taken to it with renewed vigor for the last year or so. i'm working toward completing a five-track album.

this is the video for my first release, a single called run away. i got a lot of help from reddit both directly as a result of questions i asked in the watmm subreddit and indirectly though inspiration in both the watmm and music subreddits.

hope you enjoy it :d
i'm interested to see where you go with this, so keep it up.
i am a record collector and i agree with you, all the records they offer are not worth buying.
i like "of montreal" only, and i don't know if i like the new stuff because the only time i heard a song from them was like in 2004 or 2005 i don't remember.
i mean i would like to help but come on at least give away the good stuff, there is people paying hundreds of dollars for records right now in the market.
i wish someone like you showed up to try to save the thousands of records burned at the anti-disco rally.
they should give away good stuff if they really want to save their shitty merchandise, it looks more like a publicity stunt.
look at 2 innocent teenage girls holding sings that say help us and the front girl with a playboy t-shirt, you cannot see anything else from any of them but their cute face and the playboy logo :s

your video cut out the punchline! iirc, he loses after all of that for not putting his song into the form of a question.
this was nice, but now i really want to hear the music and i can't. you sell it too well. if they're all this obscure, it will probably be too painful for me to keep coming back.

if you could add mp3 links, even for just a few tracks, you'll have a loyal reader.
how are they better? are they lossless from compressed cd quality?

my only suggestion would be to hook the reader early by drawing connections with music the reader will recognize.  1972 and glam rock, i'm kinda picturing bowie or marc bolan.  later, you say he sounds like joe cocker.  well, i'm not quite sure how to put these images together.

anyway, one other comment is that i enjoy track by track commentary when it's something i've listened to, but it's not something i'm going to read them if i don't know the songs.  i mean, it seems to me that this is great way to organize and fill content for the reviewer, but it doesn't do anything for a reader who hasn't even heard the stuff.

overall, i'm intrigued and i think you've got a good knack for describing the music.
it's a rite of passage.
it's a little difficult to read. font-size, that is. 

keep it brother!
what's the matter with you? he don't act like the other chickens do.
it's good to know you're a dinosaur then, who's still clinging to bitterness you felt from being a failed musician, and don't understand modern music distribution.  sure there's still labels pushing stuff that they've essentially stolen the rights to, but there's also thousands of bands out there who use online pay models as a means to support themselves, and you're almost assuredly taking money out of their pocket.  i'm positive you're not going to see shows for all 65 albums you downloaded (as mentioned below) before your next free leech period at your music tracker, and buy merch at each and every show, so don't try to pretend you're some kind of white knight supporting music.  you're a bloodsucker, end of story.

don't know where you're from, but in the bay area we have stanford, berkeley, and more surprisingly, a community-fucking college in the south bay, the stations are fucking brilliant. kalx, kzsu, and kfjc are outstanding stations (but like most college stations, often have their weird shit).
that wouldnt flow at all as well as it should
to be honest, i would never pirate anything by the jonas brothers.
i'm in my early 20's - and i can talk to nobody in my god-damn age range about music. one time i got excited and told a friend when i found out that the members of move started up elo. they asked me who the fuck elo was and what they're moving. every now and then i'll meet people that have heard of animal collective, but god knows they never ever heard of my life in the bush of ghosts. who the fuck is brian eno? you like that elevator music shit? grrr.

i'd like to blame corporations- yes, they're to blame for my generation being completely oblivious to everything else but the shit they're being fed! it's not like we empowered said scapegoat or anything- with our incessant need to consumerize absolutely everything uniquely cultural left over (oh, i point to you too, trendy sushi restaurants, primetime television sitcoms, celebrity's who suddenly become authors). 

yes, damn you- damn you to hell.

[rock is not dead.](http://www.mininova.org/tor/677054)
electronic music is not emerging. it's getting a little tainted by mainstream horseshit like mgmt, but it's not emerging. it was emerging in 1996. it was emerging in 1989. a lot of genres peaked in the late 90s, but were mostly suffocated around 2000 (like every genre) by business getting so big it choked on its golden steak. there hasn't been a huge surge in electronic music innovation for at least five years, if not ten.

rock's fine. anyone can do it, so there will always be hidden gems. it's also such a vague term that it really applies to a huge majority of modern music.

either way, there is no end to any genre, except punk, which died in 1982. 
i'm 50% offended.
give it time, the record industry will nickel and dime them out of business too.
but, what about metallica???

they are still edgy right?

ew. montana?
nice review. i really liked the sahb album with 'vambo' and 'next' on it. possibly called next? you're right, a criminally under-rated band.
i heard part of one song on a tv commercial, and then when i saw that joe satriani was in the band, i figured it was a no-brainer, especially with it being only $3.99 to download the album.

silly me.
where is look\_of_disapproval when you need him?
this is what happens when you combine business and art....granted there are a few exceptions but generally its not good.

also, like the mainstream comic industry the popular music industry with regards to radio is roughly only 60 years old?  that's barely enough time to acknowledge patterns of ebb and flow.  think about things that have been around for ages: architecture, art on the page, sculpture, literature etc., there you can find patterns, ebbs and flows.  i think pop music is in its infancy as an artistic outlet.  granted a very shitty art form, i hate to say it but it does take a shred of talent to write a pop song. 

which brings me to another point, i hate how we call the actual people we hear on the radio "artists".  from the majority of what is heard on mainstream radio i'd hazard a guess that only a handful of them have more than an inkling of artistic direction going into a song.  i think a much more appropriate term would be "performers".  which they do a very good job at.  but artists?  no.
upstate sc - mostly top 40, country, classic rock and 80s.  i did find a bluegrass station (or show) this weekend that was surprisingly entertaining for a bit.  haven't heard of any college stations or anything, but i pretty much gave up on the radio for music years ago, so i might be missing one.

what exactly is rock? what musical elements define rock? there are so many acts that don't resemble in any way anything before them, yet are branded as rock. how is this label granted? what are the necessary features? 

i will offer this hypothesis: rock is music in 4/4 time, with a emphasis on the second and fourth beats in a measure. it is arranged around a melodic and rhythmic electric or acoustic guitar line. it often features some variation on the vacacbcv composition, meaning vamp, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus, vamp. it often features a vocal lead. 

this is obviously an imperfect assessment, so i'm sure there are additions and exceptions.

whats with all the hate?

well it's interesting news, but i really hate these corporate-speak non-statements. 

don't they owe something to the vast majority of the people who actually put them where they are today i.e. the last.fm users at least some kind of an explanation.
yeah i love music blogs, but i usually only go to the blogs where i can download the songs.

especially when you are dealing with obscure records the mp3 blog is the way to go.

[killed by death](http://www.kbdrecords.com/) is a really good 70's-80's punk mp3 blog, and another one of my favorites is [garage hangover](http://www.garagehangover.com/) which has tons of obscure 60's garage records.


this has worked for me since sophomore year of high school and still works amazingly, also see: "the whitest boy alive", similar sounds and works well
they made a cool thing. sold it for a lot of money. now they want to do something else.

that's how i read it.
i can't believe i missed out on this shit. they played a show after a screening in d.c. recently... sold out in minutes :'(
you neglected to say that the quote is by chris martin, which lessens the impact.  he cries at everything.
thanks
well i t's just personal taste, i like the wav so i don't have to decode/encode to work with it.... i should have posted this on wearethemusicmakers subreddit.
for a regular user i guess it doesn't matter.
also most of the music you hear there come from records (vinyl) or master... why would they sell you a wav from a cd... bleep is related to warp records so they have the masters to most of the stuff.

shitty music.
i had never seen that.  i honestly though for a long time(about 10 years ago) that frank zappa was just a pot smoking know it all who just wanted to hear himself talk.  i actual describe myself as a conservative.  however more and more i am becoming moderate and by my definition i believe that everything is okay as long as it is in moderation.
this was a [great movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anvil!_the_story_of_anvil), and the happy ending really seemed like a quick high before the failure resumed. now i can feel good for these guys.

still not crazy about their music, but wanted them to have some success.
andy milonakis reminds me why i'm ashamed of being human.
if you've never been in a band, you know that it really is like being a romantic relationship, except that you make music instead of love.
i'm curious if it has something to do with cbs handing over user data.  the last techcrunch article said the creators were mad when they found out what they did with it.
happy birthday, mr. porter. 
downmodder you crazy! that track rules! had the chance to hear the whole thing, it's fantasic, better than the last two, lots of really upbeat tracks and middle-eastern music samples. tight!
just want to second your vote for 'black on both sides' as one of the all-time great hip-hop albums.

am i missing something?

&gt;here's what i'd spend £2000 on: some gear, lessons, unspecified # of cd's, marketing, transport, etc?

why not say £10,000 or £1,000,000? there are no figures here anyway.

this article (which is otherwise ok) should have been called: general stuff a band needs to buy (with no prices mentioned at all)
whoa they are going to let anyone play with them that night! 

all you have to do it bring your uke! 
video blocked in the us.
they have done this before. it is a pretty strange experience being in the crowd at that time.
i was in punk and hardcore bands. at no point did any of these bands have goals that stretched beyond getting drunk and playing the east coast. we were completely successful in doing so, and now one of them might be getting back together for a fall tour in japan. failure was never an option, because if we just played and got trashed locally, we would have been perfectly happy.

i really, really just don't care about the morality issues involved in pirating music. there's no white knight crap; i'm not concerned with bands getting my support in any way shape or form in the long run. again, i just don't like paying for shit that i don't have to.

edit: typos
you know how i know you're gay...
seen them live twice, best show ever.
the article illustrates a good observation but the author's argument could easily be turned on it's head.

the author proposes that people aren't spending money on music because they're spending it elsewhere. it could easily be argued that people are able to spend money elsewhere because they're not spending it on music.

anyway, this thread seems to be more about bashing the music industry so...

boooooo riaa! yay creative independent art!
exactly and the reason why they're leaving _now_ is that from a while you've to pay for listen and your data is subject to cbs needs ... so it is slowly becoming the shit (which it initially wasn't) :)
that you would have thought of on your own, if you actually gave a damn and weren't just pipe dreaming on the internet.

you are missing something: the time it took you to read that 'blinding leading the blind' blog.
haha. i like that.
shit.

i don't really like the idea of cbs being free to hand the riaa my user data and the data about everything i've ever listened to, even if i want to delete it. i wish i hadn't signed up for last.fm in the first place, because there's little i can do now.
try getting a what.cd account. most likely the best variety of flac you can find anywhere. i'm not sure if they're doing the irc interviews anymore though.

what's an "irc interview"? i'm not interested in illegal downloads, if that's what you're suggesting.
you cannot improve this beat i'm sorry.


thanks for the comments everybody! i am working on getting song previews. thanks for the constructive criticism!!


yeah, it's still declining, but i still have a soft spot in my heart for last.fm because it's such an awesome idea. i still gripe to people about the removal of multi artist radio. i loved that feature.
do you have a link for this? i couldn't find it on youtube
they played in some real shit holes
i don't think the 200 mark is difficult to beat, the duke of uke is selling everything that can bring to london. i actually went there last week to get a better one and the place was buzzing. it seems to have become quite fashionable here to play uke.

pft "illegal".

but yeah, they try to be really exclusive, so it's invite only but they were allowing you to go on irc and they would interview you to make sure you knew about both their policies and formats/transcoding/etc. it's kind of surreal actually.
upmodded for using the repost tag.
um, being offered 28 seconds of audio is not really an opportunity to hear the song.  
i ask myself this every time after i listen to silent alarm. i had such high hopes.
they did, but it's one of the reasons they were so great.  playing 8 days a week (in ringo's words), 8 hours a day makes for a hard day's night (also in ringo's words), but also meant that they had spent more time in front of an audience by the time they got famous than most groups play in their entire career.
like i needed another reason to dislike the jehovah's witness. prince..... wtf?
there are no words here!

edit: now there are. seems like the longest time a story with lots of upvotes went without being commented on.
why has it taken so long to find out that there is a strong possibility the initial evidence to threaten individuals for $3000 in damages?


were there any lawyers out there who even attempted to check the source of evidence from the riaa at the time of the threat?
i love silent alarm and also enjoyed a weekend in the city (and the b-sides) but intimacy is garbage in my opinion.  they focused way too much on the electronic stuff and forgot to just rock out.  sad too...
first off: be good and be professional. if your band sounds like hell no ones going to listen.
second: write some original material but do a cover or two. van halen got famous on a kinks tune.
you tube seems to be an alright place to post as good posts get views no matter what the material is. putting up a website can work.
otherwise seek out boards and forums that focus on indies and small bands. i've posted a tune or two on a few of those for free. search google. there are plenty of places to post and advertise.
you got to play live shows at bars and such or open for someone bigger than you to build up a little fan base.  one you have that, they can share your music with their friends by showing them your myspace page and whatnot. 
you are not going to make any money unless you sell out, but there are thousands of musicians that get by, by just touring and selling merch. 
leave your hands the fuck off of pharcyde please..
i was excited until the goddamn ads on the page started shouting at me. that was an insta-close.

i'm trying to use reddit from work here, people!
cdbaby, myspace, itunes, tunecore, filesharing....

also, as suggested, play plenty of live shows - word will reach the internets eventually.

edit: also, link it at reddit somewheres if you haven't already.
i like the beatles back then. i like also their music production after being famous, but i only like the voices of the early recordings when they were nobody, or when they were highly processed on the studio.
harvard law professors have a well-known liberal bias. 

oh, and fuck the riaa.
i'm assuming you're not a solo act? the advice i have is for a band, although i guess some of it coulld still be found useful. i have a background in music production, so i speak from experience. (punk shows. it's just like herding cats:)

be serious about playing as much and as often as possible. be seen everywhere. your band will take a lot of crap for a few years, but if the music is both good enough and just different enough, you'll finally start gaining some audience respect. i can't ovemphasize the advice to be different. if you don't bring anything fresh to the table, you are just another forgettable act.

unfortunately, all this new fame will probably coincide with a growing dislike between you and all your bandmates, but this is to be expected. if you can get over your petty greivances for the band's sake, you will be alright.

this is the reality. you have to accept the good with the bad. most good bands break up just as they're starting to make it simply because they can't stand each other any more. sad but true. 

 so; be good, be different, don't be a crybaby, and best of luck. 

i love silent alarm, strongly enjoyed a weekend in the city, and i feel intimacy has a few really great songs (halo, one month off, flux, maybe mercury) and a ton of forgettable ones.

i saw them live a month and half ago and they were amazing, for what it's worth. :)
well we all know reality has a well known liberal bias.
if you have an album of material, don't just release it as that will give you a one time spike in popularity. take a page out of jonathan coulton's book -- writing a song a week is probably a little extreme, but by spreading out your releases you'll keep fans interested in you and coming back for more. if your music is any good, the internet will do its part to spread it around and share it with people.
gypsy punk. check out devotchka perhaps?
you're gonna wanna check out *golem* and *world inferno friendship society*, asap.  
thanks for the support! i took your advice, and you can check out a few tracks now. 
their music never grew...
musically, the given group is like a game of which does not belong. bass is hardly a distinct musical element. for instance, bass can be a part of melody, rhythm, and harmony elements, but generally not vice versa.
i was hoping you could help me elaborate a bit... 
sorry... didn't mean to be an asshat. but i was. my bad.

my main point was that i'm sure there are a lot of rock songs that don't fit your description.  zeppelin, for example, wouldn't always be a very good rock band by that description.

remember what that one judge said about pornography? "i can't define it, but i would know it when i saw it."

rock is so broad now, that it's very hard to write out exactly what it is. what you have written out is really a description of where rock started, with rock and roll.
huh? i'll attempt to answer that piece of eloquence.

here's how a typical riaa case goes down, from my understanding.


the riaa informs you that they have evidence that you have been downloading files that they own the copyright to. you can delete the files and pay $3000. if you choose to not do that immediately, they take your ass to court. in court, they litigate for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. and they have nasty lawyers. so, before you can even contact your lawyer, you are forced to make a decision. and if they take it to court, you end up paying more than $3000 in just legal fees.

they are called assholes for a reason.
cool, thanks! i'll check it out.
ah, there are more gypsy-punk bands? cool. thanks for the recommendation. 
fuck hot chip, son.
eeeeeeh, devotchka...not *that* good.
ah, well i haven't looked yet. :p

except record labels are going nowhere because trent reznor wouldn't fucking exist as we know him if it weren't for them in some form.

yeah digital distribution and connecting with your audience using technology is great but up and coming artists still need the marketing and connections of a label to get their name out their and their songs on the radio, that is not going to change.
i love this group.  i met boots in kansas city, he opened for a bay area tour that the pharcyde was headlining.  fantastic
bands speak for themselves, i own one mates of state record anyway, seen them twice.  15 bucks for a dvd and some other cds, fuck off haters.

i've heard several radio interviews with question mark ("?").  he's an odd dude.

from wikipedia:  
*he claimed (and still claims) to be a martian who lived with dinosaurs in a past life, and he never appears in public without sunglasses.*
this band was actually paul revere and the raiders iirc.

edit - wikipedia says i'm out of mind. i can't remember who i'm mistaking them for.
so youre saying that since bass can be combined or replaced means its not important? all of these musical elements can be combined or left out. rap doesnt have melody, drones and chants dont have rhythm and solo voice or instrument doesnt have harmony. 

have you ever studied bach? baroque music (the basis for western music) was notated using "figured bass" the bass being the defining basis (pun intended) of the whole structure. it is most certainly a distinct element. you couldnt have a i6/4 v i without it.  
my god...it's like daniel johnston and they might be giants had a baby.

i discovered this in my parents' cupboard of vinyl when i was 17. i find i listen to it once right through about every 2 months or so during which i spend the whole duration of the album listening in awe.
part of me wants to push it on people, but i loved the feeling of stumbling upon it, and don't want to hype it up to other people.
hanging out with saul williams much, mr. def?
actually, i have studied baroque music, romantic music, contemporary music, even fucking asian music. figured bass has almost nothing to do with this. it's merely an anchor point to make musical notation easier. 

if bass is a distinct musical element, then tenor, alto, soprano, and all the rest of clefs should be as well? if we keep going down that route, maybe each note is a distinct musical element all to itself? that's retarded.

from his bio on imdb: 

&gt; [i've smoked ten marijuana cigarettes in my life. and they've given me a sore throat, a headache, and made me sleepy. i can't understand why anyone would wanna use the stuff. it seems such an impractical pastime as you can get sent to jail for it](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0953261/bio)
i love the various assumptions here! 
i'm not just starting out - i've been gigging for many years, and have played in many bands. i have a small following (both for my solo stuff and for the band), but the real problem is growing that support.

using myspace, cdbaby, filesharing etc... sounds great, but c'mon - how are people supposed to find it in the first place. no-one searches by name for bands they don't know, and unknowns never get listed in the genre anywhere where you might come across them because the genres are flooded with crap from major labels (well, ok it's not all crap, but you get the point).

you don't get into last.fm radio stations until you pick up enough listeners.

even using a pure internet distribution model requires a *huge* financial investment for advertising which i don't really have. unfortunately for all the talk, in practice the vast majority of internet users *still* only want to listen to music they have already heard of, and are extremely good at ignoring anything else!

anathema, porcupine tree, and camel are some of my favorite prog-rock bands..all of which hail from the uk
people listen to music to be entertained. if your fan base is small, that's a lot better than most musicians who don't have a fan base. 

if you are smart you know that becoming famous for music is really really hard, and really really rare. 

god knows that an interesting amateur video posted on youtube can generate incredible publicity. now more than ever it is possible to be truly indie because the internet makes your content available to anyone that wants it.

going after the top-40 crowd probably wont work as their ears are already full listening to kanye and jay-z. you want to carve a small niche and market directly to these people.

you have to consider the possibility that you just aren't good. most people will never find what you do interesting.

if all this brings you down go listen to sultans of swing, by dire straits. i think it's related.
they hatin... they trollin
cool to see him rockin the tympani while rapping. great coordination - harder than it looks.
i have no desire to get famous, and "good" is subjective - let's just say that some people like it (otherwise i wouldn't get repeat gigs!) so i guess what i am after is getting the songs heard further afield.

i'm not putting links here as i don't want to be viewed as using reddit as a promotional tool - i am genuinely after some other ideas on the topic!

it's a fairly niche genre (modern progressive rock) so i have no illusions that it will be enjoyed by the average top 40 listening public, but just looking for ideas to get it noticed somewhere.

i've tried getting involved in various forums, music blogs etc, and will continue to do so :-)

[edit] actually, rephrasing the question i originally asked i guess, would be "what would make *you* listen to something new, and where would you find it? what would you look for?"
kante, tocotronic
the hellacopters, radiohead, kasabian, franz ferdinand, arctic monkeys, therapy?, katatonia, mano negra and manu chao for starters :)
why do they have to search for you by name? i've bought hundreds of dollars worth of cds off of cdbaby from bands i've never heard of. i spend plenty of time just browsing the genres, "recommended if you like", and things like that.

other than that, just work on on-line advertising. myspace (as mentioned), facebook "fan" page, social bookmarking (reddit, digg, stumbleupon), put together a mailinglist of interested people at your live shows and send them email updates about upcoming shows and releases.

the bottom line is that it's a *lot* of hard work on your part. you'll probably just scrape by for a little while, but if you appeal to enough people you'll start to make name and become self-sufficient.
good call.  'specially since they share like 3 of the same members.  
&gt;i'm not putting links here as i don't want to be viewed as using reddit as a promotional tool

what's wrong with using reddit as a promotional tool? as far as i can tell, /r/music enjoys listening to music made by its members. i have no idea about the number of cds sold by "hey, reddit, this is a song by my band" posts, but it certainly can't hurt.

they used to rock the fuck out. i gave up on them when they asked me to join their "street team" on myspace.
true, but i have tried historically and immediately been voted down into oblivion.

i wanted this thread to actually get some discussion - maybe get some ideas! i'll probably try again in a new post later :-)
i agree that the search by name thing is not likely (until i actually get a known name - a distinctly unlikely proposition!).

having said that, where do you think the "recommended if you like" links come from? there is a certain number of listens required to "get over the bump" that enables my music to be associated with other bands - it's getting that initial impetus i am trying to work out how to achieve.

as an example, on last.fm looking at the "similar artists" tab for my music provides the following message:

"sorry, we don't have similar artist data for [my name] yet - they need more listeners before we can generate them"
wait i"m drinking a cup now too.  i bet it's the same reason.
i don't know this for sure, but i think you can manually enter a 'sounds like' on cdbaby. not to mention filling out the genre and descriptions to be as searchable as possible.
sorry it took 7 minutes to give you your first downvote.

cool stuff!  living legend right there.
rock was once formally described as: a blues based form of music in 4/4 time in which the 1st and 3rd beats are emphasized. it typically uses the minor pentatonic scale.

this does not explain the existence of bands like elp, yes, and rush, all three of which are known for using off beats and classical scales for their music.

maybe better definition of rock would be: a musical arrangement often featuring two or more amplified stringed instruments, a percussionist, and a vocalist although some arrangements feature keyboards. most arrangements are minimal, requiring 5 or less people to play them although some require full orchestras and choir to accompany the primary group of musicians (see: alan parsons project). rocks versatility as a form of music is unequaled as shown in the many styles available to the listener. rock styles range from basic rock and roll (ac/dc, rick derringer), country or southern rock (lynyrd skynyrd, molly hatchet), classical based rock (yes, alan parsons), acid rock (pink floyd, hendrix), celtic and baroque based rock (heart, jethro tull), new wave (devo), alternative(nirvana, pearl jam), heavy metal (led zeppelin, metallica), and thrash or speed metal (vovoid, vengeance).  the term classic rock is a blanket term covering virtually any form of the music released between 1969 and 1982. this period is often considered the heyday of the musical form. the musical form got its start in the 50's as a bastardization of the blues and was thought to be a failing form of music from the start. it is wrongly thought that it's 4/4 beat originates with african tribal music but it is more inline with 13th century celtic beats. 

hope that help with a more modern definition.

here's another clue for you all, the walrus was paul.
i found that, when i stopped listening to the radio my life greatly improved; i didn't know who lady gaga was for weeks, music was suddenly devoid of screaming disc jockeys, and my chest hairs grew around my midsection and formed a shirt with three wolves and a moon on the front.  i'd recommend you do the same.
with the mars volta releasing their poppiest album since de-loused in the comatorium, it looks like this _could_ happen, which is good enough news for me :d.  here's hoping they'll get the band back together.
that was awesome. i'd love to know what effects board / delay machine thingmy he's using...  

*edit* it's a roland rc50 loop station for the loops and a boss syb5 bass  fx.

grabbed his new album as soon as it came out. his live performances are definitely better than the studio stuff, but he's sick. 
i wanna watch him battle mike patton. every round they are given harder and harder psychedelics.
angry?  he sounds pretty mellow to me.
[seriously?](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=her+morning+elegance)

it's a good song though. the rest of his music isn't as iconic as this one. however, the video [director is a couple](http://www.onewingfly.com) that have done some pretty amazing stuff. 
this is just so good. i love this, anyway to grab it from youtube? i *will* buy the album. that's a definite ;)
i think cedric's and omar's egos have grown too large to even notice who else is playing on stage with them.

not to mention that the band sparta proved that cedric and omar were the real talent in atdi.

but since now, they're totally off the deep-end, i don't think it matters much.
lol, i had the exact same thought with the exact same video when it was posted a while back.

"[downloadhelper](http://www.downloadhelper.net/)" worked for me. avoid "fast video download" at all costs (check the comments on mozilla.org).
thanks for the tip :)
reggie watts does something similar with a line 6 dl4. 

but dub fx is amazing. ordered one of his albums from his site. 
i love atdi, i love tmv, but i just couldn't see them coming back together again, or even if they did, i doubt it would be even remotely close to as good as relationship of command.
can were the first band i thought of. accessible (english speaking, usually a strong groove), european (in the sense of being unlike contemporary 1970s english rock), good.

at the risk of piling high the german rock, i'd add faust (who were still great when i saw them circa-2000).
actually i wasnt - thanks for that. i am all over it now. is this your site?
that would be awesome, as long as thomas prdigen (new drummer of tmv) stays on drums.

so good!
i just listened to this song, clicked away, and was going to press the play button on my keyboard which would blast mr. bungle. the coincidence of it made me stop. 
ha, seeing as my buddy was the bassist in sparta i am cracking up over this. i've met omar and cedric before and they are kind of too cool for school.

love the music though.
sparta sounded kinda like at the drive-in without the clever guitar licks/pull-offs going on over the rock guitar riffs, while cedric sang his rants and melodies. though the mars volta blows sparta away, i've had a hard time listening to their last two records and wanting to sit through them again. it was the joint effort of how all of them played off one another that was atdi. cedric and omar are really talented, but they weren't atdi. atdi wouldn't have sounded like that without the other guys in the band.

i'm surprised that the passers by seem to be ignoring him for the most part - normally a huge group gathers round stuff like this...
at this point, at the drive-in has been completely eclipsed the mars volta. would anyone really be that excited to see them?

ah yeah. forgot double trouble. but never heard hurricane before. nice find.
that would be *so fucking sweet.*  i loved at the drive-in!!!!  they were at their peak right after relationship of command and then they disbanded...

edit: to all of the mars volta fans downmodding me, they are *nothing* compared to atdi.
i got my copies of both of his cd's. it's good but all his youtube videos are much better. more raw less produced. that's just my opinion though.
no offense to your friend in sparta.

it's easy to be a critic on the internet.
you're right, they wouldn't have sounded like they did without the other guys in the band. the other guys brought a lot more structure and traditional elements to omar's experimentation. there was more to atdi than just "clever" licks over "rock riffs." in that case, the sum was definitely greater than the parts.
ha. no, it was ok because i thought sparta was pretty bad myself.
no one ever brings up defacto...
i saw him perform in dam square in amsterdam about two years ago, bought a cd and have been rocking out to it ever since..
i am trying to teach myself piano - i'm an absolutely beginner and i've been working my way through an adult beginner book and so far it's been ok, i can keep time with some simple songs and play them fluently.

now i've got to play this piece in the photo and i'm really really stuck.  i've been trying for so long and it sounds horrible and choppy and out of tune and just weird.

i can't seem to figure out if it's me or it's just the type of song it is.  i feel like i'm hitting the right keys and keeping good time but the switching fingers with the right hand in the first measure and hitting the same note 5 times in a row - it sounds disjointed and choppy and horrible.

am i doing something wrong?  is it just supposed to sound like that?  any advice appreciated.  

thanks!
what's so hard about that?
cannot upmod this post enough, i was lucky enough to stumble across him around a year ago in bristol and was blown away; bought his cd without even thinking about it.  it's hard to believe it's all recorded live as it sounds so flawless
nothing is hard when you know how to do it.
i'm listening to this right now... and it's so mint.
probably because you're pounding on it like a damn monkey and holding your ape foot on the pedal without lifting it.

try feeling the time signature more, it's in 4/4 so you want to emphasize the first note of the measure, and then put a little emphasis on the third note, but not as much. also, notice the bass notes are descending in a little chromatic melody, leading to the whole note chord. so maybe put a little crescendo on each phrase(increase in volume, culminating at the whole note). mind the "p" and play it softly, but try little volume changes, be creative with it.

and don't hold the pedal down, or if you feel like you need it, lift it up and clear it on every beat.
fantastic artist, thanks for letting those of us who didn't know about him hear this!
if its all through that mic, there isn't any reason for a studio.

the future of music on the internet is distribution only, you, the musician still need to build the fanbase. that means at shows you talk, do meet and greets, push your merch. the internet is not an easy answer it is a great media distribution method that's it until you are big enough to have the following.
true, listen to blank generation, awesome song by them. ny and punk at its peak
i ordered the live album.
ok, i'll try my best to explain it, but i don't have much to go on:

i've been listening to a lot of the knife and some hot chip lately.. and i originally thought it was one of their songs.. but i think it might be a hip-hop song.. and it might be a new one..  there is a low-toned bow-row-row-row-row in the background (pronounced how a dog might say it, but spoken or sung and morphed) and it's repeated over and over again while someone raps over it (i think)

i reeeally wanna get this one.. help! :d

and i'm not saying bass is unimportant, just that i wouldn't consider it a distinct musical element. if a 3 yearold asks me what is music, i probably would explain melody, rhythm, harmony, probably tone color, but bass? seriously? just because a note is of a certain pitch doesn't make it a distinct musical element. now, pitch might be considered a distinct musical element, but bass, probably not.
i'm currently in your same position. my friend eloped (to alaska!) and is waiting for her husband to come back from afghanistan to have their reception. the bride and groom's song was randomly chosen to be livin' on a prayer by bon jovi, so keep that in mind.

[here's what i have so far](http://revishun2.com/playlsit.htm). 

just remember, this is a solid list to add and remove from. some songs are lame but for whatever reason, people go nuts over them at receptions. it'll get awkward if some notorious b.i.g. start playing.

if not, maybe a clip for some context might help.

edit: if you're referring to the shot of the 12" that says "electro" on the label...that's just a fake generic label for the movie.
average or less. just my opinion.
it would be best in that situation to run a 1/4" cable out of an amplifier and use a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter to run that into the soundcard.  a lot of amplifiers have headphone outputs that this is appropriate for.  he could run audacity, for it is free and very simple.  i mean, if you obtained a copy of cubase or cakewalk that would be optimal but those are more complicated.
i was dissapointed by the quality of a few of the tracks on his cd. i guess that's what you get when you purchase a cd made on the streets. downmod me if you like, but possibility is really poor quality.

downvoted for derogatory title.
here's some tips to gain respect.  

1) don't rap about drinking, partying, and money. everyone does it and anyone can do it. no one wants to hear it.  
2) actually rhyme. no one wants to listen to someone read their journal over beats.  
3) express at least some form of instrumentation. rap has evolved quite a bit.  
4) don't sing your own hooks if you can't sing.  

if you can't figure these things out, you don't deserver to "make it."

play music that the bride and groom love.  me and my best man put together the music for my wedding the night before -- i just picked songs from albums that both me and my wife loved.  simple as that.

well, that, and a couple frank sinatra tunes.  because, i mean, when you've loved and lost the way frank has, then you, uh, you know what life's about. 
i liked it... has he thought about giving his stuff away on places like what.cd

linkin park? 

seriously?
late 70s/80s kool &amp; the gang, my friend.  ladies night, get down on it, cherish, stone love, fresh, too hot, joanna, celebration.  

repeat.
tell him not to give up the day job.
here's the shortened list:

1) don't rap
i met him in melbourne, aus. 

awesome dude, rad music.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mai7lsefug ?
hell no.
i use to think this song was about doing one of those sex dolls.
please excuse any typos, i can barely see what i'm typing through all this smug. 

just because you can't think of good uses for them doesn't mean they're useless. i was mostly interested in this aspect of the dice:

"they also make an effective study tool: they can be used as “musical flash cards” when learning harmony, and their randomness makes for fresh and challenging exercise in sight-singing and ear training."

it's the eminem that didn't leave 8 mile...
that's the first thing you learn about the music business: it's not about talent. it's not even about writing the best music. it's about being popular. it's a popularity contest.

the consolation is that if you are actually very good, you will become popular with the proper critical outlets.
this is bullshit. 

you can write good lyrics about anything; any topic can reveal insights into the human condition or express a significant feeling to the listener.

you don't have to rhyme. that's bullshit. countless of the best poets wrote lots of non-rhyming poems. secondly, this guy *is rhyming.*

instrumentation? there's strings, bass, and synth pads all over this song. 

he sings fine.
[unedited](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtbkvdrsk8i)
heh, i love these discussions!
asking questions surely is a good way to garner information? it certainly doesn't qualify as sitting around and crying about it...
i agree with you that you don't need to rhyme if you're composing your syllables in a creative artistic manner. this guy is trying to do that but he sucks at it and it sounds juvenile. when he does start rhyming in the second verse, it's not very good. as far as the strings and synth, they're not really integrated into the beat. they're more for ambiance and are off key and just annoying background noise.  

i have to say though that i hate criticizing peoples music and i don't mean to do it here, but i am just doing it for the sake of argument. if he's making music as a means free expression that is pure from the soul, creative, and original, then what does my opinion matter anyways.  

[poetry in the streets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-r43opv1ya)
i think it is referring to the concept of using bass to provide a counterpoint or counter-melody. also, it is very interesting to watch a whole show about bass.
good on you for teaching yourself to this level :-)

now i notice this piece says "introducing sharps and flats"... can i assume you know what these are? if you don't, this could account for it sounding out of tune and weird. 

it might just be a matter of practising until you are more fluent on this piece... sometimes they don't sound right until they are played with fluency.  

what happens if you "cheat" with the right-hand fingering and just use the same finger for the 5 repeated notes.  does it sound less disjointed? 

any chance of upping audio/video of you playing the song?  it's a bit hard to give relevant feedback otherwise.  good luck!
you just made it sound so simplistic. music criticism is actually really hard, harder than it looks. i know because i've tried. that's why i really respect good art critics. 
this song is definitely on my list of top 10 songs ever, but i can't watch the video.  
i like chocolate cake. but if i ate it every day i'd start to get pretty bored with it, even if the chef who baked it is the greatest pastry chef in the world. the point is, people's ears long to hear something fresh and new, not the usual "yo, i'm drinkin', chillin', smokin' and my pockets is phat!"
yeah, but fresh and new can be about those topics. you just have to find a new way to bake the chocolate cake.
you mention the knife and you talk about a morphed voice... that sounds like something fever ray, the lady from the knife could have done. she has a recent solo album out, but i had a quick listen to all the songs on that album and none of them resembles what you describe very closely. oh well.

good luck on your hunt.

he picked the wrong guy, eh?  you're his friend and you know what you guys have been listening to in the last few years.

getting a bunch of songs from people on the internet is the last thing you should be doing.
i am impressed by your ability to miss the artist when it is right beside the video:

amazing that i can still watch it so many years after it came out and it still is a very powerful video to watch.  no bling...just a good video!



i've been working my ass off in music for over 25 years and it doesn't get any easier.

no offense, but i think this type of music is the opposite of good.


so cool this music!!!!
kanye west is a gay fish: http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/224096

no, i was thinking it had more to do with the fact the music is vapid cock rock bullshit. 

go listen to some musicians that make some original music. this shit sounds like overproduced, reprocessed nickleback.

furthermore, your generalization of "auto-tuner" being a signifying characteristic of bad music is a bad one. 

a buddy of mine wrote this article about auto-tune and its use in a musical globalism context. 

http://www.tinymixtapes.com/all-that-is-solid-07-auto-tune

while you're at the site, check out some of the bands they review. they pull up some interesting stuff.
yeah why would anyone in the world care who performed the song? fucking musicians with their stupid names and shit
"yeeeoww man, i like to drink a lot"

hahaha
i got to deejay a wedding once. they picked the tunes (way different taste than mine), opening and closing with springsteen ("thunder road", "born to run"), heavy on sinatra, ray charles, beatles. notes:

* prior to the event, i ran every selection thru [audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), normalizing volume and snipping leading and trailing silences. also compressed the more dynamic selections -- quiet passages won't work at a social event.
* at some point, an attendee asked when i'd be playing the "real music", by which he meant disco. apparently you need at least 10-15 minutes of familiar dance music. [kc and the sunshine band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kc_and_the_sunshine_band) are gods in that genre; the brides and i (no groom) had auditioned an entire rhino box set of disco tunes and everyone else sounded dull and underproduced. i later found a [pink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_(singer%29) remix that would have gone over well with the dancers.
* be prepared to shift the list around as the crowd dictates. the brides had some tunes they didn't want to wait for.
* old jewish ladies dance longer and more feverishly to a chintzy cd of "hava nagila" style ethnic favorites than 40-ish south philly women do to ramones.
* bring an extra hour of material in case things run long. some families are incapable of sticking to schedules. then stop -- the music ending is a cue that tells people the event is officially over.
* an audio cd of the playlist as performed became a favorite wedding souvenir for the newlyweds.
"illuminatedwax" -- are you the guy?
4. get caught.

edit: i wrote the number 4 above - why does it change into a 1?
well done video...mediocre musical talent.
best radiohead appearance on 'father ted'. 
&gt;express at least some form of instrumentation. rap has evolved quite a bit. 

not that you will - but if you check out some of his other vids/older stuff with the band macgregor - wax is an extremely talented guitar player. macgregor was a full rap/funk/jazz/rock band with drums, bass, guitar and horn section. 
most rappers brag about drinking/smoking - this was more about him expressing his battles with alcohol/substance abuse.
didn't watch the video, but if the reason you play music is to "make it" then you're doing it wrong imo.
i have some songs that i know he will like and the bride will like, but i'm just looking for more songs that other people might have enjoyed at other weddings.
you must not know much about being a struggling  musician/artist then. you have to eat, pay rent, pay car payments, etc. it's easy for someone who has never tried to say "it's not about the money". 

what most musicians mean by "make it" is that they can make a decent living off of their art.
i don't know what's w/ all the down comments, i really liked it.
thanks, i was looking to grab just the audio, but the mp4 format isn't unwelcome since it's ipod compliant
just the usual reddit "armchair (enter expertise here) crowd".


wow - that's an original sentiment. any "not-black" person who does anything related to hip-hop/rap is instantly compared to eminem.


is the submitter him? is there a place to buy a cd?
&gt;with that said, still better than 95% of the mainstream garbage.

yeah - thank god for the internet so people outside of the mainstream have a legitimate platform with global reach to get their stuff out there.

it's hard to judge his "flows" from this vid - this is more of a creative piece than an all out flow-fest. here is a better example of just straight flow ability:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7tpcgksw5m

* "the bitches" by jeru the damaja
* "song against sex" by neutral milk hotel
* "my second wife" by the residents
* "get out of my life, woman" by lee dorsey

... i could do this all day.
music is a very subjective thing obviously - but that shit you posted was fucking horrible in my opinion.
are you this "wax" character? 
5) be black.
i hate rhyming poems.

rap nazi: you mean "my pockets be phat!"

if he needs to promote himself he should license his music to independent movie productions. those guys are always looking for royalty free/cheap music.

meh.  not that impressed, but if the talent is truly there then what he needs is a good manager/agent/promoter.  that's what separates him and the "no-talent idiots".
last.fm does. i'm not sure if there are any that don't require giving a third party your listening habits to just get concerts from your library though. 
what is it with radiohead and geeks? this is an honest question, not an insult, that i would like an answer to. i consider myself to be quite a geeky individual, but i never liked radiohead, and never understood their appeal. 
for a wedding you can't go wrong with the theme from the original star trek tv series.

thanks
woa saw the credits, is his real name mike jones?  respect.
best american band ever. period.
well thanks - it is a great find
i have to agree with mikew0440 .. he sounds like a second rate eminem. like eminem's less talented brother.
dexy's midnight runners - come on eileen. it inspires the worst of dad-dancing, but it is an essential wedding tune.
thanks for posting this. i'm digging this track, especially eom's production.
very mediocre sounding rap. generic lyrical themes. lazy vocalizing.

video looked well shot .. but the music is a resounding meh!

maybe he would richer if he hadn't spent all his money on women and wine.
i hate bright eyes but he does have some winners.

hell yeah man
you're missing pony up!, xy lover, magic weapon, destroyer, atlas strategic, johnny and the moon  and miracle fortress to name but a few, all of which share members with some of these. it's just montreal's version of broken social scene.
thanks so much for responding.  yes, i did learn about sharps and flats and i'm playing them in this piece.

i will try "cheating" with the right-hand fingering and just use the same finger - is it ok to make these adjustments when you're learning?  i just always follow the instructions precisely.

i will try to upload audio of me playing - it will be at least good for a laugh.  :-)  also, any chance of someone who can play it fluently uploading their audio so i can use it for guidance?
i'm not using the pedal at all yet - the book i'm learning from has not gotten to that part.

also, i use a keyboard (yamaha np-30), i cannot afford/do not have room for a real piano.

i hadn't really paid attention to the bass notes - thanks for pointing that out.

can you please explain what you mean by this:

&gt;mind the "p" and play it softly, but try little volume changes, be creative with it.

what is the "p"?

thanks for your advice.
this video needs to be shown to parents and teachers alike. want to know why your kid wasted his 10th grade english class? the answers are right here. excellent look into the mind of child who's been ostracized by his class and ignored by his parents and teachers.

it sounds cool, but looks too cheese for me.

your friend is one of those no-talent idiots.
great beat and music, lyrically he's lacking.  talks about real shit and i respect that but he doesn't really do it for me lyrically.
i saw them with nin this past tuesday. i wasn't impressed. i had seen them 20 years ago and thought they were good but now they are like a *cha-ching* nostalgia act.

this statement is full of fail. fail with a capital rick astley. 
why does reddit hate rap? serious question. mainstream rock sucks, too, but i never see anyone bashing on rock music in general.
ya he's talented as hell. people shoud listen to some of his other stuff. i dont see what all the hates about. 
sorry, it's fixed!

what ever you do, don't play jimi hendrix's "hey joe" at a wedding reception. i did this (friend's wedding, it's not like i was a professional dj) because i liked the tune of the song without thinking about the words.


turned out to be strangely prophetic, in that his wife did eventually "mess around with another man" (although he didn't shoot her down.)
uh... what?
all the naysayers on here have to check out all of his other stuff.  wax is a lyrical genius !  i saw him at a macgregor show one night and he started free styling, he told everyone to hold something up, anything, and he would include it into the rap.  i help up a straw...sure enough a few sentences later he included the word "straw" into the line. haha, dude is seriously amazing ! also check out this bassist named chad buckler, the guy is an insane musical genius on the bass.  
my buddies and i in high school were really into janes back in the early to mid 90's. so one of my old buddies asked if i wanted to go to that same show up in milwaukee. i'm thinking of going just cuz i've never been to a nin show before.

this was always one of my favorite jane's songs though.

thanks for the help.
i appreciate all of the help so far guys. i will post final playlist whenever its done.
this is good man

i love the production. i can see why he hasn't made it big, so i hope he does it for love.

i looove the chorus.
i don't enjoy watching white guys talk about things.  he should learn an instrument or something.
yeah, back when radiohead was good.
that was shit.

not &gt;the&lt; shit, just shit. so, you should congratulate him: artistically he's just like the rich no talent idiots. maybe he should work on his felating skills.
ah, that must be it. op just submitted the crappy song. all the others must be amazing.
except that this particular armchair has been the work place for a lot of things you have hear/watched or played (video games).
saul williams would beg to differ regarding the rhyming and reading-of-the-journal style.  i think he does it quite nicely as it's not the typical mainstream "flow".
he was tripping in that interview. did you see what color he was?
maybe because they have made some pretty cerebral music? ok computer has some more complex song structures and details. on kid a, they started to experiment with new kinds of sounds, particularly electronic ones. they can range from being very minimal and introverted (kid a) to warm and human sounding (in rainbows). 

i can't speak for anyone else, but that's what i like about them. i think fake plastic trees is a good song and all, but honestly if they kept making albums that sounded just like this, i would have lost interest a long time ago. but i love that they always try something new and interesting while refining their sound. 

not sure if that answers your question. they're just one of those bands that people either love or hate i guess.
you and i are a gang of losers - the dears. great alternative love song.
makes you want to get up and  boogie...................................(fisherman)
i see your point, but counter melody can be created using any range of notes, not just bass. it's just that the most practical point of bass is to create counter melodies, since bass instruments in general aren't bright enough to make melodies coherent. 
hes actually a very accomplished guitarist, drummer.
can you back that up?
for some reason...i dont believe him.  oh yeah...the lyrics to lucy in the sky with diamonds.
"1) don't rap about drinking, partying, and money... no one wants to hear it."

honestly, where is this cave you live in?  so long as people enjoy drinking, partying, and money people will enjoy listening to music about these things.  
a majority of the stuff posted reddit/music is garbage. it's mostly emo/indie bullshit.
sure! just give me a good enough reason to breach my anonymity.
4:30 - looks like a guy stole his wallet from his bag
actually this isn't my favorite wax stuff. it's just his new video. i like the older stuff he did with macgregor/herbal t better to be honest. it was an actual band with drums, bass, horn section and wax on guitar.
kiss - forever

def leppard - two steps behind

the darkness - i believe in a thing called love
why would that get downmodded? the poster asked if there was a place to get a cd and i posted a link.

just what i thought..you can't.
love and kisses. i'm sure if you were dedicated enough you could link my handle to something on google. and no, i'm not walter sear. that would be hilarious, and why i chose this handle.

your friends uninspiring video is not enough.
i pity anyone who needs a "guide" to do karaoke.
pearl jam, the pinnacle of jock rock.  
well than why should i believe anything you say? if you really are an expert in the entertainment industry i'm sure you could somehow find a way to "prove it".

until you do i will just consider you full of shit.
give a counter example.
"reddit" isn't a person, and therefore can't 'hate rap'.
true. i suppose, as with the atheists, the loud annoying people are most noticed.
i'd highly recommend you going. nin is always great. i've seen them three times. 20 years ago when they were just starting out in a big way. then again in prague about 2 years ago (totally kicked ass!) and then this week. tuesday was pretty chill compared to the other times but it might because trent is *in love*. 

janes addiciton was just so so but still would be a good idea to see again. i doubt you would be disappointed. 

and the street sweeper social club was pretty good too. just a fyi.
i see what you did their.
i've been a fan of wax and his work for a while now.

this video is garbage. his other songs are better. [like this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfp9ajjxlkk)
you have enough suggestions for upbeat so i'll stick to the low key stuff.

well if he's telling the truth, then his son must be a big lsd fan.
badass. their soundscan chart would be off the hook. ill bet they had a&amp;r people all over them! hahahaha silly a&amp;r people. ill bet they can still parley this into a lucrative record deal.
yeah, my first reaction was "well, he took some time coming up with that cover story didn't he.."
no reason to send traffic to the blogospam, go to the [source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr4tnpj9goo).
those father and son chats can be so precious.
i suppose i believe him, but the refrain isn't what makes me think it's about lsd. the verses alone sound enough like a trip description to make me think it.
shaun keeps referring to electro as "the second album i ever bought". i thought it might be a fictional album, or a compilation, something like that. if not, i'd like to track it down and give it a listen.
actually, that answers my question well, and thank you for taking time to respond. it sounds like radiohead is a band that's meant to be actively listened to, and not just have it playing in the background. i am not a music connoisseur who would sit back and listen in order to appreciate the artistry. maybe later in life when my tastes are more refined. 
boring!
"out of tune"? if you're playing all the right notes then it shouldn't sound that way. 

the switching fingering indications on the right hand aren't necessary, but useful in teaching flexibility. it's all in the wrist. practice the right hand by itself, instead of using your finger strength to strike the keys, let your arm fall naturally, using your wrist as a natural lever to lift your hand/finger off the key, before striking the key again. if you can do this with the same finger smoothly in a legato fashion, then you can practice changing fingers next.
comprehension failure.
i don't know, [in this interview about "i am the walrus,"](http://www.ponderabout.com/archives/1433/john_lennon_on_the_esoteric_meaning_of_“i_am_the_walrus”.aspx) he's pretty open about how much acid they dropped. it doesn't seem like something he'd hide for one interview and then bring back in another (or is it the same one? i don't know).
do you like american music?

we like all kinds of music.

but i like american music best, baby.

i felt similarly years ago. and actually it was radiohead who grabbed my brain and made me sit down and actually listen to music. i first heard their amnesiac album, which is kind of an odd place to start listening to radiohead. but as i got a hold of kid a things just started clicking. radiohead ended up being the first band i ever found that i can honestly say i like every single track on any album (of like...three bands ever)

radiohead may not be that band for you. but just keep listening to new music, old music, any music and maybe you'll get lucky and find that group that sparks your imagination.
"singin i love kokomo"
what reason would lennon have to lie?  this is a guy who featured himself and his wife completely naked on an album cover.

no i have never even heard of this guy and i guess watmm really hates rap
od on psilocybin? my ass. it's pathetic that this site considers itself a source of news.
pretty much. there's a lot more that i think deserve the title of "best american band" more than pearl jam. bruce springsteen and the e street band. 1960's lineup of the james brown band. allman brothers, even. 
pink floyd still holds a special place for me, and i listened to them pretty much every day in college. i don't listen to them as much these days. 

i used to be a very avid [kexp](http://www.kexp.org) listener and member (even though i don't live anywhere near seattle) and found a lot of good music that way. but then i started listening to audio books in my car, and at work the music doesn't matter much, since i just use it for background.

maybe i need to start going to local concerts. 
of course they are refering to improperly picked mushrooms.  it is intellectually dishonest at the very least. 
 
*edit:  i grew them for fucksake. i must not have been clear.  i am not confirming the article. it was poorly stated at the least.  what they are doing is telling a half truth.  you can die the first time you consume a mushroom if it is not properly cultivated.duh. if you don't think that mushrooms that are improperly picked can cause you harm you are a naive fool and don't have the maturity to consume them.  

i hope you never had any of mine. it has nothing to do with the psilo... read up on how they are grown.  
fta: "mushrooms are similar to lsd in the fact that they cause people to hallucinate, and like lsd a person can die the first time they use these poisonous mushrooms, especially in the condition that they were in here"

[psilocybin lethal?](http://www.shroomery.org/6231/psilocybin-awareness)

[lsd letahl?](http://wiki.answers.com/q/can_you_die_from_lsd)

granted, if you didn't pick the right kind of mushrooms, you can definitely die.  but these people should get their facts straight.  and i'm sure if you eat enough you would want to die...but your wish wouldn't be granted.

edit: and people wonder why newspapers, new shows, et al. are losing money.
it's a wedding.  if you are going to do bitches ain't shit, do the ben folds version.
agreed.
&gt;the arrests were made after a lengthy investigation by the vice unit. detectives jeff baskette and merrill beene led the investigation.

guess you can't trust anyone these days. these guys probably didn't keep their mouths shut about what they were up to... or made it obvious to their neighbors.
that's actually a pretty good way to think about them. at least in the sense that you'll get more out of it if you're really listening closely. most of my favorite music is the type of thing that you need to listen to multiple times to fully appreciate it. 

when i was younger i heard a handful of records that i didn't understand and i knew i kinda liked them, but i didn't know why. then the more i listened trying to figure that out what was going on there, the more i grew to love it. ok computer was one of those records for me. 
http://www.paulisdead.co.uk
if you needed a lengthy investigation at 'roo to find people selling mushrooms, you're not doing it right.  you can sit in one spot for an hour and someone will simply ask you.
good use of tax dollars.  stake out and arrest people in a controlled environment causing harm to no one.  what next, spying on people in hopes they commit sodomy in their bedroom?

oops, my bad.

this just in.  getting in a car, airplane, train or sailboat for the first time may result in death.

not to mention bicycles, elevators, crossing the street, going to your local hospital and eating at mcdonalds.


i think you would die from indigestion from eating fucking mounds and mounds of mushrooms before you died from a psilocybin od
right. it's the owners of the credit cards that have been scammed.

well i'm guessing once it came out the credit cards were stolen, apple and amazon would have to pay everything back, and the royalties, they would have lost that money.

people die falling out of bed in the morning.  
i enjoyed the part where they specified "creative thinking" as a symptom of use.
there are such profound lies in that article. what's so sad is that many (most?) readers will not question the outlandish and disingenuous statements made by the police. 

and it sucks that three non-violent college educated young men have had their life ruined by liars.
that is very helpful.  i will practice doing that.  thanks for the advice.
&gt; "the detectives in the vice unit as a whole should be proud of this investigation," he said. "there's no telling how many lives they may have saved by keeping these drugs off the streets."

self-righteous, ignorant, hero-complex, dog-killing cops.  save the rationalizations.  just keep putting people in jail because it's the law, not because you think you're some kind of public servant protecting the people from themselves.
i'll try to remember this next time i think i'm having a bad day.  
great documentary on the history channel the other day, detailing the history of the drug war. how it started with nixon, and adding lsd, psilocybin, and marijuana to the schedule 1 drug classification was all about controlling the hippy anti-government rallies.

once nixon was determined to be a crook, they should have overturned all his policies.
"and like alcohol a person can die the first time they use these poisonous mushrooms"?
hey now guys.  you know it's entirely possible to od on these because they don't come in a little plastic jar with a description of how much to take and whether it should be taken with water or a meal..
they're referring to little johny jumping from a bridge thinking he could fly.

(has this ever actually happened?)
yes.  and i really did fly.
er, that's not a statement by the newspaper. they are quoting the police spokesman, who is unsurprisingly lying and/or an idiot.
people die while sleeping.

**stop sleeping, sheeple. it'll kill you.**
he's just fucking with our heads
did you read the quote?

&gt; "mushrooms are similar to lsd in the fact that they cause people to hallucinate, and like lsd a person can die the first time they use these poisonous mushrooms, especially in the condition that they were in here," said murfreesboro police spokesman kyle evans.

yeah, that's just a flat out lie that hallucination causing drugs can kill you.  lsd doesn't kill you and neither does recreational mushroom use.
that's what happen when you feed chameleon's lsd

they start turning weird colors and fly off into the sky with diamonds

very true.  but they do not refute the statement and therefore are just swallowing the pill that the police officer gave them...and passing it along to their readers.  rather than being an actual journalist and researching things...

it took me about 2 minutes to research it...probably less than that.
definitely agree about saul williams. his stuff is pretty much the only stuff i can listen to.
reporters should be allowed to yell out "source!" when hearing this shit.
*"the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms produces a variety of symptoms in the user, including euphoria, creative thinking, sensation of insight, intense emotional sensitivity, time perception alteration, change in consciousness, closed-eye visuals, intense feelings of fear, anxiety and confusion."*


except for the rare occurrence of the last 3 symptoms it sounds like something everyone should be required to try.
me too.  there are a lot of kinds of mushrooms and maybe a bad reaction to a psilocybin-containing shroom for non-psilocybin reasons is possible.
yeah that's rough.  i think i might accept personal injury to protect a stradavarius.
what can i say... yawn... yeah, that's it. not bad, but nothing special. i want artists to put something extra in their music, before i want to here it again.
a couple people have actually overdosed on lsd, but to be fair, they thought they were shooting amphetamines and ended up shooting something on the order of thousands of doses of lsd, worth tens of thousands of dollars.

that said, i am not aware of any psychedelics that become deadly until you get *at least* in the range of hundreds if not thousands of doses.
he did! i saw it from my mind's eye.
its called the 1st amendment.
a tragedy to be sure, and one that happens *everyday* in the u.s. for *no good reason at all*.

i tend to think there are worse problems in the world, but none quite so easily solvable by a change in public policy.

can someone remind me what the judicial framework (case law / reasoning) for not striking down drug policy as unconstitutional is?  does it really come down to interstate-commerce (for the federal level)?
yeah, all "journalists" are like that though. this is what they call being objective. "joe politician says that early humans used to ride dinosaurs like horses. his opponents claim this is false." there you go, objective, even-handed coverage.

&gt; "the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them, inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors. he who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false."

* thomas jefferson to john norvell, 1807. me 11:225 
actually i was a reporter for a while and in this case i probably would have contacted a doctor or professor at a local college to get a quote based on their knowledge of the dangers of recreational drugs.

you don't ask the cop for his information source because cops are programmed to give you these kind of answers. their source being anti-drug pamphlets left over from the dare program.
picking mushrooms at the wrong time can indeed be poisonous. i always had to be careful.  i am not defending the poor reporting and leo spin seen in this article.

 i am instead trying to educate anyone here that contemplates growing their own and saying that it isn't as black and white as saying "you can't od on psilo."  there is a risk in eating mushrooms that were not grown, picked, or dried properly.  there is plenty of materials out there for anyone considering it.
lolololol

misrepresentation of a bald-faced lie.

also, why is this in /r/music?
well that was definitely much better, but he just comes across a douche. you can't talk about the exact same thing as the "idiots" you claim to hate, but differentiate yourself because you don't get famous  for it. 
as a long time summer touring and show going dude i have sold and came encounter with those bars numerous times. they are well done atleast the ones i had wrapped in foil even had nutritional info on them made a crap ton of money on tour with sci and wsp. 
bonnaroo related
my issues is there is no counter-point to the officer's claim.  he says both can kill, they take it as fact and do not mention anywhere in the article that this could possibly be a complete falsehood.  
yep. this is ... the first mainstream news article you've read in a while, i take it?

edit: there may be a bright side, though -- it may encourage, at the margin, people with a modicum of critical thinking skills to view politicians and law enforcement types as, in general, stupid liars. this can only be a good thing.
"droogs"
mainstream us news article...yes, probably so.  it just saddens me to admin that.
im simply stating the ability to speak one's mind given to u.s. citizens via the 1st amendment.
so bonnaroo is going to suck then i guess.
possible to take too many? yeah, sure. 

but od? i suppose that depends on your definition of the word. generally when i hear "overdose" i assume a life threatening situation brought on my taking too much of a drug. mushrooms, lsd, pot, etc. can be taken in amounts large enough to cause extremely uncomfortable sensations or make you feel ill, but they most certainly will not actually put you in any danger.

(sarcasm detector is broken today)
although there is an outside chance that you could die laughing.
new youtube exclusive - the making of "crazy cousinz feat. mc versatile - it's that funky" this is a behind the scenes look at the making of the test promo. take a rare behind the scenes look at the whole team in their element.
nice. thanks for this. glad to see they headlined. 
indeed.  in fact, i believe i read something linked from reddit that mentioned lsd has less of a footprint than aspirin.
which brings up the obvious point that anything at too high a dose can kill you.
"citation needed!"
email the reporter and editor, it will likely have an impact if you point out why it was bad journalism.  bitching on the internets to unrelated 3rd parties will get you no where.
wow, if there was ever a time for **wake up, sheeple** you just missed it.
c'mon guys and gals. if you don't make music, promote someone unknown who needs some exposure!
they were quoting the police without adding any conjecture of their own. that's what a good news paper does. tell it as it is and let you decide. maybe they put that in there to make the cops look like idiots.
here's my old punk band [the virgin splits](http://www.myspace.com/thevirginsplits) and we played sloppy drunken garage punk and my newer project [instant feelings](http://www.myspace.com/instantfeelings) which is garage r&amp;r with a country blues feel.
ah ha!  i was trying to put a backslash in front of the 4, and that was working, but the slash was still be displayed.

thank you.
i always used to wonder if statements like this were really true, then last year i went to a similar but much smaller festival here in ms(~300 people). and while sitting at our neighbour's campfire we got offered everything but opium, it was great. 
i think it's more because "wax" is just an imitation of the garbage that is broadcast on the radio. repetitive beat, terrible hook, and nonsensical lyrics mainly about drugs and girls. 
except weed. that is, no one has ever reached that high a dose yet. hold on, brb.
if i had to die, that's how i would want to go
there is telling how many lives were saved: zero
[this](http://www.myspace.com/legendoftheminotaurs) was the band i was in during the 90s. basic three chord punk, but it sure was fun to play.
recommended: "just met you" reminded me of iggy pop, "pussy reaction" has one of the best titles!

i'd love to hear a studio recording. what guitar is that? it sounds like a telecaster?
well, you do have to die, but anyway, i'm not sure that would be a terribly fun way to die. i'm guessing it would probably be more terrifying than being hunted down by a group of dinosaurs that are known to start with the genitals. just because drugs are great doesn't mean that they are fun to overdose on.
oh, btw i will upvote anyone who bothers to post regardless of whether i like it or not.

(i'm sick of negativism on reddit!)
i did.  i was just wanting to discuss the topic here.
but honestly, what's the difference? it's not like these guys were neighborhood drug dealers. they specifically said that planned on taking it to the event. law enforcement knows what goes on there, but they don't do anything at the actual event itself. 

if cops just got a list of ticket holders for these shows a day in advance they could make hundreds of drug busts in a single day. yet still no one would be better off for it, of course.
translation at the end:

why aren't you playing now? you had a pretty tight sound.

thanks man, the guitar is an old short-scale silvertone amp in case guitar through a 60's japanese elk tube amp. i only play the swankiest of cheap crappy instruments.
oh come on! why the down vote?
surely this is what it's all about?
(any downvoter care to comment about why they are downvoting?)
i've posted us on this before: [clark 8](http://myspace.com/clarkeight) rock/powerpop/etc.  i sing and play guitar.

then there's this: [sounds of asteroth](http://myspace.com/soundsofasteroth) kinda like hedwig and the angry inch if that was a band instead of a musical...  i play rhythm guitar in that band.

actually, prozac surfing wins for the classic riffage.
we're still going to call them out when they're lying
i tried listening to the everythink album. at first it seemed great, then the rubbery-lip sound of his kick drums started to grate and eventually i had to stop. frustrating.
like the songwriting. i'd come to a gig...
thought "retirement" was a bit like the pixies.
lol you said high
aspirin ods have killed many people.

there are no confirmed lsd overdoses.
sounds of asteroth is going in my playlist.
:-) 
ok, that's my first purchase of the evening - just bought "big top hotel" off itunes.

cheers dude!
maybe... maybe if we extracted the thc crystals, and it got it in the range of 1500x extract, meaning 1500x more thc in every gram, and then, we took an ounce of it, and vaped it all in one bag, then hit it... you might go crazy enough to kill yourself? maybe?
a "sears catalogue guitar"? awsome!
and to think i live here...
sounds clever, but it's just a really stupid way to launder money leaving a huge paper-trail. 
a person may die from tasers as well.
big top hotel was all done before i joined.  :-o  heheheh.  but thanks!
sincere thanks. yeah, it's got that loudquietloud thing going.
-rich
don't know why, i prefer jazzpollution. my first instrument was trombone! could do with hearing more bass in the recordings though.
loved the riff on "everything is broken", reminds me of miles davies plus a bit of funk!
dat was the only album on itunes! i'll be listening out for the next release ;-)

the site is just reporting on the bullshit coming from the authorities.
a bad trip, however, is a fate worse than death.
singer's got a great voice! kinda folk country rock... this needs a second listen definitely.
the most illegal drugs, schedule i, are the psychedelic drugs and pot. these are the ones for which there can be no medical use. that's how dangerous these drugs are. schedule 2 are like heroine, cocaine, other barbiturates and amphetamines. they make other drugs out of these. every one knows the schedule 2 are far more dangerous. how long must the joke continue? down is up, black is white. believe the tv. believe the propaganda. the world still needs changing. that's why we must speak the truth and be the truth and not perpetuate the lies. the general population is being lied to, this article is a perfect example.
not od in the stereotypical heart failure sense, but taking too much mushrooms can make you commit suicide. happened to my friend... he thought his mom was baking his cat in the oven and got the scissors out.

i have done shrooms too.
shame you deleted it - you sounded good. (i've still bookmarked it though)
yeah, the worst thing that can happen is you will walk outside barefoot and develop a spiritual connection with the king of the trees, all while jotting down your experiences on a note pad.
well, it's late and i'm going to bed. this has been a bit like a private gig - surprisingly i've enjoyed everything i've listened to and will pick this thread up in the morning!

disappointingly, none of the downvoters explained themselves - surely this can't be a bad thread? getting musicians heard must be a reasonable thing to do?

anyway, if this gets more comments, i'll keep my promise - i will continue to listen to everything, this was fun!

yea but that is like saying that if you travel at 1000 miles an hour your face will rip off.  anything is possible, but many things are very unlikely....this being the case.  

i once witnessed a friend of mine take a sheet and a half (150 hits of lsd) all at once.  he couldn't talk for most of the night....and had crazy acne for a week....but he came out fine.

edit: fine may be an exaggeration....more like he didn't die..... he  definitly had a unique view of life for a while.
i'm willing to try it...for science of course.
no, a good newspaper finds out the truth and reports that ... they do not just parrot authorities.
the worst part about this, is the fact that people will take this to be a reputable news source, instead of just going to erowid to find out that this article is chalk-full of shit.  this is the kind of fear-mongering that has kept our drug policy in the dark ages for the past century...
haha, no

remember that bad trips aren't really all that bad, just a bit stressful and frightening.  there's a full spectrum here, but generally speaking a bad trip is easily put behind you and not truly devastating at the time either.  death is a pretty severe fate for recreational drug use.
okay, maybe you could die from huge amounts of mushrooms, but you cannot die from lsd.  it is the only non-toxic drug i have ever heard of (i did a research paper on this for a psych class). 

after choking down horrible tasting shrooms for years, a friend introduced me to shroom chocolates and there is no going back.
reagan fine-tuned the war on drugs to an art form.

remember which political party was behind all this.  obviously the democrats aren't in a big hurry to overturn stuff, but one party definitely is no friend of legalization, and that's the gop.  remember that when you think supporting ron paul will help the cause.

mad downvotes in the music subreddit world.
i think they are on after limp bizkit and korn.  at first i thought this was some kind of sick joke when i saw fred durst.
hmm, according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stradivarius#violins), the violin was not a strad. it was a guadagnini. 

he had a strad on loan at the time, a 1718 called san lorenzo, but he crushed a [1772 guadagnini.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giovanni_battista_guadagnini)
well, isn't that part of the reasons they were criminalized? 
i don't buy it.  the acronym is simple, but obvious.  jim morrison also denied "she get high, she get pie eyed" had anything to do with drugs, as the song would get banned.
they must be dangerous. by reading the article alone, op lost his ability to keep subreddits straight.
magnificent bastard!

what is this website again?
http://bartonpatrick.bandcamp.com

i'm currently working on a getting a band going for my music, but it takes time.
well the difference between getting busted at the concert and getting busted at home is that someone has to rat on you to get busted at home...

&gt;if cops just got a list of ticket holders for these shows a day in advance they could make hundreds of drug busts in a single day.

no probable cause, and therefore no home search. however, they could set up a roadblock on the road into the concert and walk k9 units around every vehicle. they wouldn't even need reasonable suspicion -- k9 sniff isn't considered a search by the supreme court.
that's why the first rule of hallucinogens is to have a sitter.
http://www.sgsrock.com  =d
in other news, a car can also kill you the first time you use it.
after only the one bust?  i could hardly take a step without being offered a cocktail of various drugs when i was wandering the shops area years ago.  i can't imagine that changed.
this. anyone who does drugs other than cannabis by themselves needs some help...i don't see why you would bother, really. especially hallucinogens.
[metal mark music (myspace)](http://www.myspace.com/metalmarkmusic)

don't be too harsh...haven't put any new music or art on there for over a year. i used to be in a couple bands, one of which [(tempus mori)](http://www.myspace.com/tempusmori) was semi-successful in the western mass metal scene during the hayday of bands like killswitch engage and shadows fall. we played small shows with them, god forbid, all that remains and a plethora of others. i still write a bit here and there but since starting to focus on my web design stuff, i've been neglecting the song writing. gotta get back on it again and start playing with some musicians.


i think if the gop went unchecked, they would destroy the world and everything in it, just for the sake of making a buck.

i'd like to think that's a bunch of bullshit, what i just said... but i'm having a hard time coming to terms with all the nonsense of the fart right.
isn't that what the news is supposed to do? i mean if they were to change what the police said that's one thing, but reporting it exactly as they go it, i don't see the problem in that.

although, do did have some pretty crappy reporting.

i have one album that im trying to give out to whoever wants it and im working on my third album in my kitchen. im stoked
just ask peter green or syd barret.  of course a underlying mental illness probably contributes as well.  
i agree, it was more of the obligatory statement along the lines that the anti-drug group try to play up the dangers of drugs at every chance when they are often no more dangerous than our average household substances.

also, love the line 'unique view of life'...  i'm curious more about how that went.
i like it. shes good.
generally speaking?  things may loom large but rarely are trips so bad *you'd rather be dead*.  rarely do they actually disrupt the further living of life; rarely do they actually disrupt your social standing, or get you fired -- this is probably because people are generally responsible enough to trip on weekends.

out of all the bad trips out there happening at any given time, the overwhelming majority are experientially awful at the time and not at all *devastating*.  the word 'generally' fits here.

that's not to say they are forgettable in the least.
my roommate also makes music. his stuff is http://www.myspace.com/fogeymusic
the "also" is inappropriate. the lethal dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms is so large that it is effectively impossible to eat that much.

i tend to agree with you.  i do believe there is a large group of very rich, white, christians who are in support of israel mainly because they think if they can settle palestine, they can get all the jews together and jesus will come.  it's not that far fetched when you see how many very rich, very powerful white dudes subscribe to some of these insane policies.

i mean, the notion that the upper echelon of government thinks they're engaged in a holy war seems ludicrous, until [evidence starts showing up that makes you go wtf?](http://bsalert.com/news/2515/rumsfeld_sent_bush_war_memos_covered_with_christian_propaganda.html).
| intense feelings of fear, anxiety and confusion.

of course, these are usually attributed to *situational* symptoms, imo. they aren't really *rare*, however. anyone who has done mushrooms enough times to understand that it is indeed a tool, and not a toy, knows this. same as any psychoactive substance, such as lsd or dmt. don't get me wrong, the experiences i have had changed my life in a positive way. but, when put into a situation where a user gets too comfortable with being in an altered state, such as constant use where he/she puts the guard down can end up in a situation that can cause even suicidal panic. still, i think the benefits out-way the possible negatives, and the writer of this article (mark bell) seems to agree at the very end (well, not the *very*, very end, where he throws in the other possible reactions) by his description of "symptoms". probably not his own [opinions] though.
well it was pretty wild.   we had to keep happy thoughts in order to keep him okay.  i once looked at him with concern.  he noticed me staring(i was tripping to) and he had an instant look of terror. 

i had to reassure him that it was all good for about 2 minutes.
so?
and you would definitely want a trip sitter.
mdma would probably be okay without a sitter though, right?

edit: no, i'm not going to do any, just curious.
as someone who grew up in the deep south and had these mushrooms grow in his backyard.  i can tell you first hand they are not dangerous.  my friends and i once filled a one of those big black garbage bags about half full with these mushrooms for an "event" we had planned.  not one person got ill from them.  we did, however, have one hell of a good time.
awwww, you guys only had 5 friends
dude thats awesome!!! im so watching that. korn is on right now, not so cool, but ive never seen a live webcast of a show. love it!!
ron paul scares me, but not because he wants to *impose* strict regulations, that's for certain.  he runs under a republican ticket so he can have a glimmer of hope of being taken seriously. 
:d just saw some boobies!
"drugs of an unknown type".  sounds like a good name for a rock band.

and i love the last paragraph: 
the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms produces a variety of symptoms in the user, including euphoria, creative thinking, sensation of insight, intense emotional sensitivity, time perception alteration, change in consciousness, closed-eye visuals, intense feelings of fear, anxiety and confusion.

i guess the cops think you can *die* from too much creative insight.  wicked major fail.  bad cop, no doughnut!

to be fair, they were quoting cops from murfreesboro, tn. i used to live there. i'm not surprised.
http://www.averagejoepcrepair.com/misc/zn.rar

here is a recollection of a strange experience i went through.  i am mostly a fan of rock, but sometimes when you jam with other people with other interests, the results can be quite strange.  this album was the result of a collaboration between me when i was 22 and a co-worker in his 50s.  all nine tracks were recorded over three sessions in 2001; all of them were spontaneous improv.  no writing, and the final mix is 90% the same as the original recording.  i played guitar and bass, with various effects including delays, flanges, a digitech whammy, and an ebow.  he played keyboards, including a really nice kurzweil.  everything was a direct line-in to a mackey 24 track mixer and output to a sony dat.  this allowed to talk during the jam and discuss which direction to take while we played.  the last three tracks were recorded on september 11, 2001, we watched the coverage on the terrorist attacks on a small tv that sat on top of a speaker stack while we jammed.  as a result, these tracks (tense anticipation, war, uncertainties) are the darkest and most haunting, and they bring back vivid memories every time i listen to them.  oceans apart is most people's favorite, and lament over broken glass is my personal favorite. 

these tracks are far from masterpieces, and to many people, not even music.  but i enjoy them nonetheless, and if someone here does as well, then great :) 
actually, it's a bit scary because it makes me think they might be trying to be objective...
fart right is right.
mushrooms are the one drug i would consider doing again some day.  maybe when my kids have grown up and moved out.

mushroom chocolate bars sound awesome.  we used eat them raw with peanut butter and that tasted pretty gross.  i've made mushroom tea before too, that's not so bad.
i'm not a fan of any of those bands but i'm liking it anyway

myspace.com/mymagicalmusic
the "p" here means "piano", not referring to the instrument but the dynamic. dynamics in a piece of music refer to how loud and forceful it should sound. piano is soft, with a quiet, light sound, in contrast to "forte" (f), which is more powerful and louder. "mp" (mezzo piano) and "mf" (mezzo forte) are in between, and "pp" (pianissimo) and "ff" (fortissimo) are even more extreme. dynamics are a big part of taking a piece from the level of merely plunking out the notes to actually playing it.
thats amazing that they can repair it after 100k and 8 months though. back to what level, though? i wonder how they do it.
i really recommend uploading it to torrent sites, in particular private trackers dedicated to music. waffles.fm has a program for members who are musicians where the album is made "freeleech" and heavily advertised, ensuring many downloads. what.cd doesn't usually offer a freeleech on such torrents, but will announce them on the main page. i hope i don't sound too elitist when i say that users of these and other similar sites usually have a very sophisticated opinion on music and will surely give you some helpful feedback if you leave a contact.
yeah, you've made a mistake in your definitions.  i'm being as literal as i can.  devastation is not something that happens to people often.  devastation is loss of limb, abject life course change, etc.

"put behind you" is an expression, so i'm sorry about that.  my context is regarding wishing you had died rather than lived through that bad trip.  i don't know any drug users that would rather die than have lived through their crazy bad trips.  alcohol causes more problems in my experience.  mind you i've had a lot of exposure to drug use and i don't say these things without a relevant perspective.

you can respectfully disagree, but why don't you unpack yourself and tell me why?  i have my reasons for using it, but if you don't like my rhetoric then fix it.  i think you are thinking that "put behind you" in an expression that has to do with forgetting something, but obviously i don't meant that.  i use the expression in terms of real life significance.  i don't think "wow that was heavy" (unforgettable) is anywhere close to "shit, that changed my life for the worse permanently" (unable to move on from a bad trip).

generally speaking bad trips are bad times, not devastating times.  i don't think there's anything wrong with that sentiment.
&gt;i think if the gop went unchecked, they would destroy the world and everything in it...

i think if the *government* went unchecked, they would destroy the world and everything in it.

pretending like the democrats can do no wrong is extremely dangerous.
i used to eat them fresh picked in sandwiches.  pb&amp;j, salami and cheese, whatever, they're quite edible in sandwiches.

peyote, now, that's another story...
although yea, a little too similar to muse for my taste.

actually, you can die from ingesting incredibly small quantities of mushrooms.

there are a lot of different species, and  psychedelic types like psilocybe *cubensis* and *semilanceata* are non toxic.  others like *amanita* are mostly deadly, although the *amanita muscaria* has psychotropic effects which may affect some people positively and others negatively.
i've experienced "*intense feelings of fear, anxiety and confusion*" in many situations without having ingested any drugs whatsoever.  especially back when i was in primary school.

our new single, "satellites" (in the wee music player - not the video).

you rock!
it's hard to tell about zero.  kind of like trying to divide by zero.
it mostly comes down to a bunch of fools who, generation after generation after generation, vote for democrats and republicans.
in my younger, stupider years, i got pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving (i was pretty drunk).  cop was fairly reasonable and i was completely cooperative, he even commended me on my performance on my sobriety test, but being under 21 i took a breathalyzer and was well over the legal limit.  i was placed in handcuffs and then asked if i had anything illegal in my pockets or anything that could stick him.  in my complete nervousness i failed to remember that i had a bag of magic mushrooms in my pocket.  then the "oh fuck" thoughts popped into my head and i promptly told the officer what i had in my left jeans pocket.  he reached in pulled them out and intermediately radioed something in.  5 minutes later there were literally 6 more cop cars on scene, they began to treat me as if i was freaking scarface.  then one officer continued to harass me about how people on mushrooms go crazy and kill people, and asked me if i ever felt that way.  my only response was i told him that i felt sorry for him that he never experienced the focused, calm, and creative effects of the drug.

the drug possession charges were eventually dropped by me pleading guilty to the dui.

metal from the heart of buggy, buggy virginia.  likened to nevermore, more like sanctuary imo but whatever works.
not to be a dick, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the system.
how come i never hear in the news "man dies of overdose of magic mushrooms"? must be a conspiracy or some junk.

well, here you go.  stuff i've been doing on my own: http://www.myspace.com/ocalaocala
you sure as hell won't commit suicide on it anyway,unless you where considering it beforehand.  

some people don't like being alone at any time and others relish it.  same applies with psychedelics.  
really not into the whole introspective trip thing, huh?

&gt;ron paul supporters think along the narrow minded collectivist bullshit lines you laid out for us.

no, they're in a totally new class of nuttiness: disgruntled republican/conservative/objectivist/fundy douchebags who think the government is to blame for every problem on the planet.  and the sooner we dismantle the government and hand over basic services to multinational corporations, the quicker we can all stop paying taxes, start smoking free weed and kicking immigrant ass!

q: is there a conspiracy against ron paul?

a: yes. a large group in the us has decided to block his rise to power, since his policies would grievously threaten their interests. little is known about this shadowy organization beyond its name - the voting public.


he's also a medical doctor that claims there's no such thing as a medically-necessary abortion, an [evangelical christian](http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/ron_paul) who thinks the earth is 6000 years old, jesus hung out with dinosaurs and that america is a "christian nation" that should not have any separation of church and state.  that's about as un-libertarian as you can get.  the fact that so many of his followers haven't added up his nutball agenda and seen the *insane* conclusion at the end, says a lot about his followers.

nobody said the democrats can do no wrong.  

however, the gop has done a lot more wrong than the democrats.  it wasn't democrats that lied to the american people and invaded iraq. it wasn't democrats who traded arms for hostages.  it wasn't democrats who invaded panama or got bogged down in vietnam.  it wasn't democrats who created the "war on drugs".  it wasn't democrats who [rolled back the post-depression-era regulations](http://bsalert.com/news/2416/what_caused_the_second_depression_in-a-nutshell.html) that led to the financial crisis.

democrats have done some stupid shit, but the republican policy has killed millions of people, run up the deficit, bankrupted the country, ruined america's reputation and destroyed the economy.  you cannot say that about the democrats.  they might have played along here and there, but the *architects* of the calamity were always republicans.

hell, reagan is pretty much single-handedly responsible for aids exploding in america by ignoring it for many years.  bush has basically done the same thing with global climate change.  democrats have no such track record of burying their heads in the sand when important social issues like that need to be dealt with.  they're always the ones picking up the pieces from the fucked up party the gop threw.

what's the most important *real* issue today?  healthcare.  why won't the democrats be able to do anything about it?  because the republicans have created such a huge bullshit strawman called "socialism" to make it political suicide for anyone to effect any major change.  and again, the conservatives are responsible for no major progress in an important area of our society.  

in short: republicans are fucking up everyone's future.

are you looking at anything besides dillinger escape plan?

check out battles.
true, but it's also possible someone injected hiv into all the watermelons at the local market. 
it's a far cry from rock, but you might like idm. try squarepusher, venetian snares, and aphex twin on for size. 
not yet, but last i checked people were what consisted of the majority of both parties. if ummm... being alive, has taught me anything, it's not that people are inherintly evil or any bs like that, it's that the good people generally have no desire to control others or run things, so the greedy, 'i can't get enough' assholes are always the ones in power. democratic, republican, it's an arbitrary distinction to keep you from seeing the actual problem and instead just fight between the two. they really just take turns at fucking us over. 
stereolab is good for unconventional time signatures in a pop context, especially anything they did in the latter half of the nineties until today.

i like margerine eclipse.  it has a song in 13/3 (or something like that).
i've never had anything, 'unreal' like that happen, but i did lose my sanity for 2 months after an lsd+mescaline trip at the beginning of the year. definitely not a drug to take unpreparedly. 
it would, but mdma is really *the* socializing drug. once your rolling you'll wish you had invited a friend over. definitely don't need a sitter though. 
even alcohol? and, based on your post, i'm thinking you've never tripped? 
see... if *i* ran the newspaper i wouldn't be reporting on the cops seizing some mushies, i'd be reporting on the cops seizing some mushies while being ignorant and incompetent. then i'd tell my reading audience some facts so that they can protect themselves.  
&gt; i know a christian who fixed my strad copy or matias albini violin: he is a german. mr. garrett i can refer him. the person is through the lutheran church in san diego, cal. god can fix it right people- cannot be trusted with your violin mr. garrett. sincerely a christin violinist friend.

i really don't understand the logic behind this. 

1) god can fix it
2) people can't be trusted
3) send it to a different person.  ???
nore are they poisonous in the least. 
that still doesn't make it right. police are *supposed* to protect us, not lie to us. 
next time you eat acid, immediately start thinking about your mother's tits.
it was well over 20,000ug+ i'm pretty sure. an average hit is anywhere from ~30ug to 250ug. 
i think i'd probably just get tired. 
that's fine, but if they are just saying what the cops say, there isn't anything wrong. i mean, they are reporting what they are told. however, when they start to twist things and not give the correct facts when they talk about it, that's a problem.
have you tripped before, cause that most certainly sounds like one of the worst ways to die to me. 
false equivalence fallacy.

i can give you a list of humongous ass-fucking issues created and executed by the gop.  there is no comparable evil perpetrated by the democrats not even close.

i guess you think "lying about a blowjob" is the same as "lying about weapons of mass destruction and invading a sovereign nation and killing 800,000+ iraqis and 4000+ americans"?

not the same.  not equal.

you're arguing as though i disagree with you on these points.
most of my bad trips i was convinced i already was dead, so no point in killing myself again. 
there's one. the guy thought it was heroin i believe (something injectable anyways), and for some reason had a bunch of pure lsd crystals, he injected em and... died. 
though psilocybin, psilocin, and all other tryptamines effects are modulated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, a class of antidepressants that was very common until recently, when ssris (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were developed.  so yes, 'someone', namely someone with serious depression who didn't tolerate ssris, could die from eating mushrooms. of course, they could also die from lots of other things, such as lots of chocolate.  this is how yage works, the vine supplies the maoi and the leaves supply a very small amount of dmt.  the maoi allows the dmt to act at very small doses.

don't try this at home (lots of vomit).
dude, you might want to check the dose on your medication.

my beef with ron paul is based on my own research, some of which i've posted [here](http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/ron_paul).  if the current crop of ronbots aren't blindly downmodding anything unfavorable about ron paul, it's probably because they saw something shiny elsewhere and are temporarily distracted.  don't worry my friend.  they'll be back and your little world will once again be ordered as it should be.
it would make jesus cry. 
downvoted because it's true.
i'm just adding some additional substance and references.  you said he scared you.  i detailed why he scares me, too.
about zero:

.00000001
i hadn't heard about the ultra-religious side personally, just the "withdrawal from all world politics and economy" side and the "abolishment of our current government and reversion to a 250 year old us government" side, which are both pretty frightening.
amanitas are totally different though. no one calls those 'magic mushrooms' and they aren't even a psychedelic. i doubt anyone other than internet vendors would be selling those either. 
[www.myspace.com/followfreeman](http://www.myspace.com/followfreeman)

no, i don't understand.

ron paul does not believe in separation of church and state.

ron paul does not believe in evolution or global climate change.

not all sides of an issue deserve equal consideration.  at this point, if you think the earth is 6000 years old, that's not some kind of "alternate viewpoint that needs to be considered."  it's *crazy*.  it's not-qualified-to-be-commander-in-chief *crazy*.  we just went through eight years with one of those crazy idiots in power and look what happened.  

also, i think you need to look up the definition of [freethinker](http://www.freethoughtpedia.com/wiki/freethinker).  you are apparently confused.  it does not mean "thinking freely" - it means opinions on issues should be based on facts and not emotion or authority.

downmodded because i really hate linkjacking.
**stop sleeping sheeple** is totally good enough.
nice - there's a pub round here this would go down great.
this has been going on for a couple of thousand years on a much smaller scale perhaps, before the discovery of combustion via oil and nukes.
and never gone on a binge and tried to get through the first few sober days?
that was unexpected. i'm not sure what to make of it, but you are right it is cool.
don caballero is a math-rock band with no screaming, and they do some more melodic bits. here's [an example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwpuylznwsu) and [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xod_crp-yqs).

though obviously not math-rock, frank zappa uses some ridiculously bizarre rhythms and harmonies on a lot of his albums. \[edit\]oh, after looking at your previous posts, i see you already like zappa. excellent choice.\[/edit\]

king crimson's got some nice and weird stuff too.

some jazz fusion, like the mahavishnu orchestra, has some really wild stuff in terms of rhythm and melodic structure.

and finally, something that isn't rock music at all but which i am obligated to mention every time someone says "atypical rhythm": the dave brubeck quartet. they were probably space wizards or robots or something, because they managed to record multiple albums focused on atypical time signatures, and even to get some of the songs into the billboard hot 100. what mere human could accomplish that?

\[edit\]i apologize in advance for recommending 4 bands that aren't math-rock at all...\[/edit\]
worked just fine in safari 4 thanks!
lots going on in there, nice production.
a few for the ipod there! i love the ambient feel.
a rar file?

downloading now - will listen when done!
you're absolutely right, but my point is that this particular bust seems just as ridiculous to me as going after people at the concert.
classic singer/songwriting! i like the tunes.
did you by chance have a commodore64 at one point?
"the groove" reminds me of rob hubbard and sanxion - that's awesome!

mushroom chocolates are the best. one of my old roommates tricked me into eating a couple once, i was pissed but then i had a great trip, thank god it was a saturday and i did not have any plans. i would have killed him if he did it to me when i came home for my lunch break.
i meant anyone who posted music (e.g. participating in this!). so far i've enjoyed everything i've listened to - although admittedly i wouldn't necessarily normally listen to all of it!
neo prog. this is ace! good song, astronaught.

cheers! i didn't know about that subreddit, and i suspect i am not alone in that!
goth, trance, metal.

pretty dark with good riffs!
minus the bear?
well, we wouldn't want the proles "thinking creatively" now, would we?

they might start getting ideas "above their station".

and we can't have that, can we ;-)_
your mothers sexuality makes you want to kill yourself when you're tripping?
i get it, you don't like speculation.  what's in the literature is the claim that some people have died after eating psilocybin mushrooms.  obviously i don't know why.
now you're just trolling me.  thanks, kryptobs2000!
well imo by not stateing that the police are wrong they are leading the reader to assume what the cops say is true. 
i made no claim that they are equally as bad, just that they both are bad. bash the gop all you like, but don't defend the democrats simply because they are *less* evil and corrupt. 
the most over played piece of crap was ice ice baby!
well i wouldn't say the problem is speculation in itself. it's obvious that either the cops are just ignorant, or are purely spreading misinformation. sure it's possible that some mushrooms are contaminated, or that the user could be allergic to something or w/e, but that can be the case about *everything*.

since mtv means anything but music tv these days, and a high percentage of the younger reddit crew wasn't was too young to miss what mtv was really like back in the day, and thus many younger people are not aware of many videos that older people witnessed!

after spending ten years a couple hours east in the north carolina mountains, i'm not surprised, either. i'm in watuaga county. we were the first in the state to prosecute and convict a guy making meth in his trailer on *terrorism charges*.

no, really, a guy took some over-the-counter drugs, cooked them down into their base elements to sell to junkies, and we convicted him of *terrorism*.

i take back the "ambient" tag, i just listened to "back to crissian". what is that track about?
i'd love to see a live show of this, i'm adding this to my listen again list!
hey, i loved it the first 49 times i heard it too. 
sounds amazing! is it just you or a band?
and slaves to money reminds me a lot of "something in the air" by thunderclap newman, there are some similar parts.. :p
anyway, you have some really great songs, thanks for sharing.

glad you like it. which is weird cause i submitted this to watmm and it was downmodded straight away :(
thanks alot man! :d
upmodded simply for containing "pink floyd" in the title.
[here is](http://www.last.fm/music/le+kingste/_/eustace?autostart) another track they've recorded that isn't on their myspace.

how is it over there? is it considered as no biggie to publish full names and ages, not to mention partial address, of three guys not yet convicted of anything? 

in my book, that's not cool. i mean, the article would have been just as ludicrous without the names.
greatest ska-core band ever, imho.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlj4yxqka5g
he's really not that great. have you ever heard the quartet live? desmond always shines on the sax, whereas the piano is invariably uninspiring and dull. 

don't get me wrong - i really, really love the music - but brubeck himself wasn't so amazing.
from erowid:

&gt;the first, which is mentioned in psychedelics encyclopedia by peter stafford, is discussed in a 1977 journal of the kentucky medical association article. in this case, "the quantity of lsd in the blood indicated that 320 mg (320,000 micrograms) had been injected intravenously" under the mistaken idea it was speed. the amount (320mg) was an estimate by the authors of the article and not based on direct knowledge of how much was taken.

&gt;the second reported death, for which there is toxicological data but no details about the circumstances leading up to the death (ingested dose is not known, though post-death blood levels are), is documented in a 1985 forensic science international paper. unfortunately, so little is documented in the article that it is hard to say much about this event.

&gt;there are a handful of other reports of serious problems (but not death) caused by very large doses. one person who took 40 mg survived. another report outlines the case of a group of eight individuals who snorted large quantities of powdered lsd on the mistaken assumption that it was cocaine... all survived.  

so it looks like 20,000 ug isn't even enough, somebody survived 40,000 ug (40 mg). the ld50 has been estimated at anywhere from 12 mg to 5+ g (12,000 ug to 5,000,000+ ug). damn.
&gt; "you were brought up playing in four-four," brubeck says. "everybody could walk to it and dance to it. put an extra beat on it — **everybody's tripping**."

sounds so fake.  (i know it's not.)
something happens to a teenage boy when he watches the wall for the first time (and second and third and fourth.....)

black metal. tight as f**k. this rocks. your singer has great range man.
i have a loose collective of musicians that are in a number of bands (and i am in a number of bands myself), but this is my own project and i played that myself.

thank you! in early 2005 (i was 19) i got my hands on a multi-track recording program for the first time--which happened to coincide with a rough transitional/introspective time for me. mockingbird was the 4th album i made in 5 months (by far the most productive i've ever been) and is probably my favorite, though it's definitely the most ambient.

 you might also like the albums theatre and etudes (the latter was the first of the 4 so you can clearly tell i'm figuring out how to record/mix/master for the first time, but it has some good tracks on it i think, like t.o.t and segae and a few others.)

thank you so much for listening!
nice video - shame it's defunct, i liked it!
clutch is an american rock band, formed in germantown, maryland in 1990. they have been playing together since the early 1990s, and released their first ep, pitchfork, in october 1991.
too many to review - i'll listen through them all. introspective and laid back so far.
now i'm just freaked out, "skin specialist"?

honestly though, ditch the drum machine, or get a real drummer.

vocals are pretty eerie, even without the subject matter. piano is great.

[edit] dazzled is not quite right. try slightly uncomfortable, but can't stop listening...
he he....ya, myspace sucks.  long live the mp3!
sucked me in with that intro. fecking hell this is amazing, love it!
[edit] that production is really awesome. and the vocals are just spot on.

kudos dude. this makes it all worthwhile - are you signed?

[second edit] f**king hell - i love this track.

not my type of thing, but great recording and i appreciate the song writing.

no, i'm just planting the seed in your own head to open up the giant waterfall that is all your insecurities, whether they have to do with your mom or not. ;)
was exactly my thoughts.
&gt;lying about weapons of mass destruction and invading a sovereign nation and killing 800,000+ iraqis and 4000+ americans

are you simply ignoring the fact that congress voted in favor of the invasion of iraq?  a congress that consisted of many democrats.  have you seen the quotes of the democrats who also said iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction?

your play on this is a typical one.  ignore the facts and place all of the blame squarely on the gop's shoulder.  even though wmds were believed to be in iraq by england, germany, the un, nancy pelosi, al gore, bob graham, ted kennedy, robert byrd, john kerry, henry waxman, hillary cliton, and [others](http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/demquotes.html).  what happened was a massive global intelligence failure.  not the gop sitting in a dark room conjuring up lies to feed the public.


haven't seen that in years.  it's still just as cool.
then he must be really hurt...
thank you.  i happen to be the singer.
tom waits

i remember trying to be into his stuff when i was like 15, but i couldn't dig anything besides rain dogs. last week i borrowed orphans:brawlers, bawlers, &amp; bastards from a friend and haven't been able to stop listening to mr. waits since then.

bloodhound gang                                   
the prodigy
this scared the shit out of me the first time i watched the wall baked off my ass.
dada.  listen to the album american highway flower.  hopefully my love of this album is not just nostalgia.
nice.
i totally agree, i was never the same.
no joy on the download i'm afraid...

love the feel in "from birth to death", wtf is acousmatic?

it may hurt to be seeing him now, as an arthritic eightysomething.  i saw him for the first time five or six years ago, and was concerned that he was actually going to die right there on the stage.
good songwriting, "city, i need you now" was my standout.
[edit] got a "cure" thing going on there. couldn't think what it reminded me of.
i prefer the more melodic stuff, like "the visionary" but there's some accomplished playing there.

you shouldn't let the web work get in the way of the music...
crimpshrine!

i miss lookout! records...
black mountain
mastodon

rock, rock, rock!!!
added to my listen again list.

good tracks.
know what you mean, good luck getting the band - that's a ton of work on it's own.

nice songwriting!

nighthawks at the diner is a great album. i recommend it.
up-vote for classic home computers.
something beautiful.
&gt;are you simply ignoring the fact that congress voted in favor of the invasion of iraq?

i knew someone would pull out the "two wrongs make a right" fallacy.

congress voted that way because they were **lied to** by the administration.  colon powell stood up there and lied his ass off suggesting they had evidence iraq had wmds, at the same time they were trying to silence their own intelligence community who disagreed with their claims.

that's actually an **exact** retelling of what happened to me the first time i did shrooms. it was my friend that "discovered" the "tree king" though.
the kinks. it's unfortunate that they don't get as much recognition as the beatles or the stones, but if you listen to their albums (all the way up into the early 70's) you'll realize what an amazing band they were. lyrically and musically. 

check out the albums arthur, something else and village green.

the problem is, the jingoistic cliche: *they're both bad* is a way to discourage people from further investigating the actual issues involved and making their own choice.  by dismissing both parties, nobody ever learns what makes a good party or politician.  and then they're destined to always have bad representation.  and the fact remains, there are still discernible differences between the parties in terms of ideology.

as i said before, they are *not* "equally bad".  not all acts perpetrated by various presidents are of equal severity.  just like lying about a blow job is not the same as lying about another country's threat to the united states and getting a million people killed as a result. 

not equivalent.

you can take every example, from vietnam to the economy, and compare the different political parties and their contribution to things that went wrong, and in almost each case, you'll find the republicans' contribution was much more substantive.  

it goes without saying the conservatives pander more towards corporations (and powerful lobbyist groups like christians and israelis who are basically corporations too) and democrats pander more towards people.  this is pretty well acknowledged by everyone.  when this activity manifests itself in public policy you see things like the dems supporting labor unions, civil rights, and social services and the republicans supporting deregulation, military intervention, invasion of peoples privacy, state-sponsored moral codes, and anti-drug crusades.  each party has their own pet projects, but in the big picture, these pet projects have their own pros and cons which can be examined and judged.  there is one difference between those served by both parties: people have an imperative to be moral; corporations do not.  and as a result, we see the corporate agenda operating with less foresight, ethics and morals.  and we end up with war over resources, taking away human rights and industries unfairly exploiting people and resources.   the democratic projects do not damage society or humanity anywhere near the extent the republican projects do.  this is just the way it is.  yes, there are a lot of projects both parties engage in that aren't necessarily good, but when you take all that away there are fundamental differences between the parties that are clearly qualifiable.  

for example, the democrats are the primary party in favor of addressing global climate change.  the gop doesn't give a shit and will have to be dragged kicking and screaming.  the same thing about alternative energy sources.  the gop is perfectly content with coal, nuclear and drilling oil wells up your ass as a "solution".  the democrats are in favor of solar, wind, geothermal, changes to cafe standards and other progressive ideas that will result in less dependence on middle east resources.  this is a fundamental difference between the democrats and the republicans.  one of many, that people can see and figure out for themselves.  and for every one "green" republican, you can find a dozen green democrats who were doing it first, before it became politically-correct.

yea, the democrats want to raise minimum wage.  the gop says this will kill industry, meanwhile they kill industry even more rapidly through deregulation, corporate globalization, deficit spending, and destroying the working class by refusing to offer perks and tax breaks to anyone but the upper class, and refusing to do anything about the messed up health care system.

so yea, the democrats want a national healthcare system, and the gop screams, "socialism!  the world will end!" meanwhile they enact tort reform and bankruptcy reform so people who go broke trying to pay medical bills because their health insurance sucks can't get out from under their debt.  every other modern nation on the planet has better healthcare than the u.s. and who's standing in the way of that?  the republicans. 

there is a difference between the parties.  that more people don't know is a testament to how ignorant they are of the issues.
have you ever watched the wall... on **drugs**???
amazing voice? check.
great acoustic guitar playing? check.
cute singer? check.
harmonica? check.

she's basically amazing.  i've never met anyone who after hearing about her decided they didn't like her.
have you ever watched the wall... **sober**???
i know, i would've loved to be part of the late 80's/early 90's east bay punk scene.
foals! on a related note, i'm considering buying buying out dfa records' back catalog... 
why would someone think another world war is a good idea?
please do download both albums and give them to anyone who might dig it. it's...yeah. i never know what to describe it as. "rap rock" just makes people turn away in disgust. "industrial hip-hop" isn't quite right. you can tell from the samples and album titles (*fenix down* &amp; *fission mailed*) that both albums are influenced by video games; but they're also quite dark, for the most part.

anyway, it's amazing how hard it is sometimes to get people to download a free fucking album. your enthusiasm for new music makes me happy, drstrange.
thanks for the reminder. i haven't seen this is years.

downloading now :)
i should have linked to this before: [2007 album](http://childrensmasterpiecetheatre.net/mp3/2007%20-%20eponymous/). 

you'll notice, if you download it, that it's the singer from the proscriptions. i played bass. it was good times.
i want to tell the genres apart better than i do, but there are just so many..  look at this mess: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_electronic_music_genres (!)
i hate to be closed-minded but the commenter says the system of a down cover is better than this original...

i don't even need to hear it to know he's wrong.

i respect dream theater infinitely more than system of a down and even their covers are missing a certain something.

there is only one pink floyd.
chance's end
sometimes you can tell the level of intelligence a person has just by knowing what music they prefer.
well, i'm a metal guy myself.

if you played "diamonds and rust" by joan baez for someone and then told them that judas priest had covered it, i don't know what they'd expect. but i love priest's cover, maybe as much as the original. but soad aren't in judas priest's league.

i just think pink floyd is uncoverable. and i do like and respect dream theater and les claypool's attempts. but it isn't the same thing.
maps and atlases

i'm no metal guy, but even i can see that judas priest is clearly better than system of a down.

i have a friend in that position. he can't wait to get shipped off to afghanistan to, in his own words, "shoot up some of those taliban bastards". 
he's admitted to being aroused by videos of firefights.

have you ever watched

##the wall??
they are a fun jam band, and have created some interesting sounds and lyrics.  not always my cup of tea, but still great.
what are you, 13? if you are trying to troll me by sounding like a complete idiot, you are working.

btw, nice move with deleting your comment. real classy.
nice one!
i guess this one does a decent job, though it's not nearly exhaustive

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjnaeewhsci

you wouldn't believe how hard it is to give stuff away! it was that kind of apathy that prompted me to start the thread.

you are most welcome, and i promise i will listen to both albums, as well as to hand them on to at least one other like minded person!
roger waters solo albums, particularly [home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6peywjw5p8) from radio k.a.o.s.  all his solo stuff was amazing.

also journey and styx i have rediscovered having heard them on the radio and realized all their songs sound great as piano-only interpretations.
mp3 downloads! feckin aye! this is on my ipod this week.
flesh of lost summers? it's growing on me!
[edit] big pixies influence there? the vocals particularly (mary murder). cool.
this one's a lot better:

give [ishkur's guide to electronic music](http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/) a try.

it doesn't include some of the newer subgenres but it'll give you a good solid foundation of the history of electronic music. 
i'm really pleased with all the responses! i've spent a day listening to stuff that i previously would never have heard, and enjoyed all of it far more than i was expecting.
don't give up you guys, that was awesome!
one could argue that it's the democrats inaction that creates an opportunity and/or need for the republican action.

for the sake of argument...

if bill clinton wasn't embroiled in the lewinsky scandal at that time, he would have been more likely to pull the trigger when they had bin laden in their sights... as it was, he gave the orders to stand down, not wanting to stir up more shit.

you could also argue, the only reason he was in that mess was because of the republican back lash... i digress....

although i think his impeachment process shouldn't have denied him his responsibilities as president... the fact is, if a president can't keep it in his pants for the sake of the country, then i don't think they should be leading.

democrat or not... it just seems that those sorts of scandals lean left.
also, they are great to listen to whilst tripping and/or high.
speaking as someone who has been w/o many friends in the past weeks because of, "phish tour", i can only say that while the band is interesting and the music at times quite excellent the real reason so many people are so strongly drawn to them is because of the vibe and atmosphere of the shows. and when i say vibe and atmosphere i mean drugs and crazy sounds and lights.
not lame, whimsical!
don't knock it, it's honest music. win.
they are amazing in their creativity. many of their song lyrics sort of take the listener on a journey.  i recommend the record "billy breathes" if you are interested -- good examples of nice melodies, lyrics, and their signature use of non-verbal vocals. it's all very creative and interesting. 
if she wants something she can actually play melodies etc. on the etherwave by moog is just over $300 and is the cheapest you could get that is good as a musical instrument.

if she just wants to make crazy noises and have fun there are a bunch that cost less.  lots of good theremin forums you can check out for those.
i almost missed this one! blimey, i had no idea this genre even existed.
i'd be interested in hearing a proper recording, the video is really hard to make out. looks fun though!
do you like phishsticks?
yeah, they went less for musical, and more for artistic i guess.

i saw zz top at the hollywood house of blues a few years ago, and i would still say it was the best concert i have ever been to.
thanks, yeah since posting this i have done more googling and found lots of info, i just thought some reddit users might have some personal input.

the b3 theremin looks good. cheap, not overly shitty. 

but perhaps ill just wait and get her the moog complete pack with the theremin stand and amp and accessorys some other birthday :p
crazy tremelo! this brings back memories...
not a big fan of the "goth" label but thanks for the listen :d
yeah i just unfortunately had to sell my amp and electric (5150 and a ltd h-302) due to being incredibly broke and unemployed at the time. joel stroetzel from killswitch has my old amp though and i could probably buy it back from him...definitely a thought thats crossed my mind more than a few times. thanks for the words of encouragement.
i forgot to add the beatles, they weren't on our original list (as you can't find them on itunes or amazonmp3), just got from a friend's laptop when he showed up.  a few songs from them:

i wanna hold your hand

something

hard day's night

hey jude
acoustic singer songwriter - sounds good, but i'm not keen on the short previews on the website... would rather hear the whole song!
drugs.
the widdler?
goth's not a negative word in my world - it's dark and industrial is what i meant!

killer
love the vocals and tune on this - it's a quirky track, love it.
good beats, funky but even, like the bass modulation and choice of timing. keep it up!
glad to see some floyd lovin' here on reddit. my fav video clip from the wall. perfect culmination of the floyd's peak. 
the band
re: pixies, i wouldn't say it was a big influence, although we are fans. i'm not sure where i'd say the vocals were influenced, because they changed a lot from 2001-2007, and you see a wide range even in this album. but i'd say influences in general ranged from nirvana to weezer, placebo to deftones, nine inch nails to teen pop stars (honestly). and of course the entire gamut of stuff you listen to in seven years.

flesh of lost summers may have been influenced by [rusty pipes](http://vimeo.com/channels/23298/), if i remember correctly.
xtc, particularly their dukes of stratosphear songs.

also, fairport convention.

i'm going through an atypical stage in the development of my listening tastes.
the church.
dear reddit,
this friend of mine keeps bringing up this video clip his music teacher showed him when he was in high-school years (he is now 25). he described it as a view out of a car where objects apeard in on the beat of the music. at first there were only lampposts and than all sorts of stuff happend, birds, airplanes etc. sound familiar?
moog makes some decent ones, though retail is a bit out of your price range you could probably find one used floating around ebay and the like

[moog etherwave theremins](http://www.moogmusic.com/theremin/?section=product&amp;product_id=14)
[try this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwvtkuqacp8)

the song in the video is jung at heart


yes, i like phishsticks.
apart from all the other reasons already listed here, these guys are virtuosos. they are four of the most talented musicians in the world.

yes, i have been to a few shows and own a few albums, but i admit they are not the world's best songwriters.

but the world needs bands who can jam, man.

and when it comes to the jam, there are few in the world who have the talent to do what they do.



also drugs.
[chemical brothers - star guitar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odd6ogdnwsu&amp;fmt=18), though the view is from a train not a car.

i detect a new degrees of separation game
thank you very much.
thoughts?
much better than i imagined because that isn't a cover at all.  it is merely a spoken word portion of a show with a nod of the allusory type to pink floyd as he believes the message he is trying to convey is similar to that represented in that song.

i highly doubt soad would claim to have covered that song in any way.
do you like to put them in your mouth?
omg, i think this is it. 
(remembered him also saying something about a shed and a train)
i bow before you sir!
and whit what a speed you found it!
should be able to give you more karma for this.

context is everything..

i'm pretty sure at this point you were being facetious when you said bad trips were worse than death.

they can be pretty uniquely terrifying, but thankfully they do stem from insecurities, so even bad trips can teach you about yourself.
i upvoted him for you 
music is music. if they actually wrote it, and it's not a sample, then no they didn't steal it.
i don't even like coldplay, but this is going to get ridiculous soon. people will sue each other for having two chords / notes in the harmony the same.
people don't, dirty hippies do!
this was fantastic!  time to go explore contemporary classical pianists, i had no idea there were people this good!
no.
i was being facetious, more or less. i've not had such a bad trip myself, but i know people who have, that's all.
he's just mad because coldplay's song is more catchy, and generally much better.

to me those songs sound sufficiently different.
[no, this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40k2s0-5xo0)
pete townshend always said that he didn't give a shit about new stones or beatles albums.  he was always looking to see what davies was going to do next.

they lost a step or two after muswell hillbillies, but regained it from the late '70s (low budget) through "word of mouth" in the '80's.  really, those albums don't resonate as much as their '60's stuff, but that's the material that got me into them, so it has good memories.
that's kind of silly. by your reasoning, vanilla ice didn't steal from queen and bowie, because of the extra note.
oh yeah, i used to skate to this in the early 80's. takes me back. austin was a lot of fun back then. 
jane's addiction.  just caught them live at jones beach.  muthafuckas can play.  i felt like i was watching zeppelin.  four guys who own their instruments (though perry's voice had its vulnerable moments).
that one's pretty cute too!
boredom.
interesting and informative videos. i am and have been curious to see how this will fare in court. i am not quite sure what the verdict will or should be, but i have to admit that i am pretty convinced that the two parts of the songs are significantly identical.

of course, as a guitarist, i am doing my best to keep my disdain for coldplay and favor of satriani out of my opinion, but the bias will always be there.
hmm....not wanting to go back to a place i've been even when others i'm involved with have a plan to. that's the best i can explain, not that it's so profound it's ineffable.
thank you! i love me some fnm.
surely you cant completely misunderstand the appeal of music to said people, so clearly you aren't looking for a literal answer here.  rather, why don't you just go ahead and tell us why you posted this question which seems more to express an opinion than to gather info?
not impressed
&gt;what happened was a massive global intelligence failure. not the gop sitting in a dark room conjuring up lies to feed the public.
the 'drugs' are a cancer on the band.  and by drugs we mean pills and stuff you shoot and snort.  there was a time when nitrous vendors in the lot were considered scum of the earth.  people there for the 'scene' and not the music.  anyway, i am dating myself.

id also add:

* different setlist every night
* long sets
* extensive song catalog
* sometimes you get lucky and they bring out a special guest who they tear it up with
* audience participation
* ck5 on the lights
* very 'open' recording policy/redistribution 
* good ticket policys to avoid fees
* good vibes
* garlic grilled cheese

**edit:formatting**
sorry, that music store thing is new to me. thought they previewed the whole song. you can hear full tunes at my myspace.com/joeyoga or youtube.com/goyogago

thanks :)
but it's not like he made millions and became err...semi-famous *because* he used their music. it was because he was shit.

lyrics are fair enough, but single layers of music tracks and note structures shouldn't be a controlled thing.

say you hear something you like, and you wish to produce a track around that. surely it should be a merit to the original producer, and a demerit in the way that someone can chose to not listen to your music just because you used someones melody instead of writing your own.

i know hundreds of people will disagree with me but i stand by my argument.
upmodded cause i was on acid when this was posted.
that's a fairly simple tune and it is possible, although unlikely, that it was an accident.
i like their music because it is through-composed. i know as a classically trained composer that the main reason to repeat music is because you are lazy and don't want to do any work. phish cut the bullshit of chorus/verse and structured the music however they wanted.
music is crazy like that, especially pop music. there's really only one chord sequence. haven't you seen the [pachelbel rant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdxkvqy7qlm)?
its silly, have you seen that mash up that shows that every song went together well with coldplays song?  i think that just goes to show that its really just a generic riff.
if you are interested in another great and overlooked british songwriter from the same era, try jake thackray.
wow, i have to admit, the stevens version sounds even more similar. if he took that to court he would definitely have the odds in his favor.
yes, i like to put them in my mouth *&lt;shrugs&gt;*
i have no answer that will not offend phish fans, and this time i choose not to offend people without a good reason.

why did you post the question? serious inquiry or just want to phish bash?
i think at the time i was just too young to appreciate [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96jftzva80a).
true, there is only one floyd (and i'm a big fan), but i would love to hear system of a down's cover.  will it be better?  who knows, who cares as long as it inspires a new generation to examine great music (something i think current generation suffers).  

besides, any cover is a tribute to the original.
wow, that is pretty insane.  was that song ever intended be played by a person?

my aunt has one of these player pianos that uses the big paper rolls, played with it all the time when i was growing up.
moby and tom waits
[fnm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3944wqrcg2k&amp;fmt=22)
down. the super band!
he says the two songs share 2 of the 3 elements (rhythm and harmony), but not melody. but in fact, the melody is the same as well - at least the first 6-8 notes of it - that's the similarity which is the easiest to hear! i can't imagine why he missed that.

not saying satriani necessarily has a case though. at the end of the day, the number of musical creations is finite (since there are certain conventions in western music that almost all artists abide by) and we are bound to unintentionally "duplicate" sooner or later.
i chose it because i didnt know. but since you asked: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acousmatic
im thinking i might just get her that one at some point, cos even if she gets it and plays with it for 5 minutes, i myself would not mind a theremin :)
i like how the song is about ohio sucks
is that going to be the new rickroll?
i think what really happened is that coldplay just used a very generic sounding melody and chord structure that has been used many times before. it's the main thing i dislike about coldplay. they're not horrible, but their music has just become very bland and uninspired.

[here's yet another comparison of songs that sound like coldplay.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de3lvudmoaw)
i'm really enjoying listening to alot of paul van dyks work.
/2cents
this is the second time today i've seen this guy with that roland thing stuck to his guitar!

but both of these songs are pretty unoriginal; if two unoriginal songs in a  business that  sells unoriginal songs happen to sound alike... satriani is still a fucking tool  
i actually disagree with an aspect of the harmonic analysis here- the second coldplay song is clearly not a simple eb- there is a db in the strings, and the rest of the chord is ambiguous (no third or fifth that i can hear).

listen to the transition between the first and second chords. hear the note in the strings that stays the same? that's the db.

so let's say it's two chords different. 
weird this popped up today on reddit. the wall was one of my favorite albums as a teenager, but i hadn't listened to it for years until i listened to it start-to-finish today in the car. 

and i realized that i never really understood the lyrics, the whole concept, until today. truly a masterpiece.

it's a shame roger waters couldn't realize that floyd had that special sound because of what the 4 of them could bring to the collective table. i like rogersolo and the post-roger-floyd, but when you listen to any of those albums you can hear that something's missing, when comparing it to a unitedfloyd. but oh well, they gave us some amazing albums. right, i'm done. ;-)
m83 and firewind
&gt; the melody is the same as well - at least the first 6-8 notes of it - that's the similarity which is the easiest to hear!

i believe the melody is really the only thing that matters in a case like this because i don't believe you can copyright a chord progression. the same progressions have been used over and over again thousands of times in popular music. but the similarity of the progressions might help him make his case about the similarity in the melodies.   
i (and i assume most others) have no problems with sampling or using another's original musical idea, as long as the original artist is credited. of course, i think it detracts from the overall creativity of the piece, but incredibly creative works can be derived from the works of others.
if you watched the videos, he points out that he is making a relevant and well-informed analysis of the similarities between the songs, rather than simply creating a mashup, which is useless for most intents and purposes.
the silver apples
[this dude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc67c94wsx0)
i upvoted you for them.
exactly. moreover, all these stupid mash ups served to compare melody only. but as this video explains, there are more elements which are too similar here: same tempo, same groove, same progression, and same melody.
serena maneesh

dead can dance (particularly their 1st album)

death in vegas (thanks to reddit!)
ive never been to a show. i dont really like jam bands. but i can see how getting a bunch of people together who are stoked about being together, all celebrating and doing drugs could be a good time. could also be a horrible time if it doesnt go well.
i vaguely remember it when i was 7 or so...

catchy
they have holdings in haliburton or the carlye group?
the groove and tempos are about as generic as they come, so that's a non-issue in my mind.

the progressions on the verse and the chorus are both standard stuff as well, but the fact that both songs have it the same keys, and very distant keys at that lead me to believe that coldplay probably did rip this off. 

but that being said, i do think suing someone over this is retarded. i'm not a music lawyer, but i think it's stupid to think that anyone can own a *diatonic* 4 chord progression in two minor keys, a tritone apart.

punk rock = "look at me, i can grind the same three chords over and over again and act like an idiot too.  look at me, i'm so counter-culture and revolutionary even though i dress and act just like everyone else in my social clique."
&gt; where objects apeard in on the beat of the music

despite seeing the video before, i'd never noticed that. thanks!!
that's when you get if you write pop music. all pop music is basically the same old stuff with slightl variations.
to quote the motherfucker that killed mozart "too many notes".
what a punk response.
unlikely? that riff is incredibly common. i've never heard either of these songs before now and i've written songs with that progression. i didn't intentionally steal it directly from another song. you hear progressions like this everywhere, especially in pop music.
is that a bad thing or a good thing? 
you like tartar sauce?
i've never had the opportunity to go to one of their shows and i don't touch drugs at all...but phish is still one of my favourite bands. 
something missing from this guy's analysis and from some other rants is the actual rule of copyright law wrt music. specifically, you can't copyright a chord progression, so the vague sameness of the progressions is irrelevant. also, you can't copyright a title, not that it relates to this case.

but, you can copyright a melody, and the melody of viva la vida is a straight rip of the guitar melody in satriani's tune -- hence the lawsuit.

whether or not it sticks is about judges, lawyers and settlements, but if it's adjudicated by the letter of the law, then satriani will win, because the infringement is very specific and precisely in the legal "sweet spot".
i love dan deacon. how did this make the front page? 
follow up: there's a song called "silence like the wind overtakes me" that he only plays live. it's amazing. check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1zgebyzkcg 
hitler thought the 2nd one was a good idea.

it's rare to hear a cover of happy birthday because of the cost to obtain the rights to play the song. 

that's why whenever you go to a restaurant they don't sing happy birthday to you, they sing crap like "happy happy birthday yeah yeah clap clap"
here's another one from the same album.

[coldplay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj4qbrh_nr0#t=0m45s)  

[sonic youth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btfg9wrsab8#t=0m15s)
it wasn't just the progression, it was the temp and everything. sure i'm skeptical, but i doubt the band wrote the song anyways. they probably hired some "kid" to write it and they ended up using that.
&gt; let's do the music theory.

ugh...where did you learn to mangle english in such a manner?
&gt; this is going to get ridiculous soon. people will sue each other for having two chords / notes in the harmony the same.

slippin' on that [slope](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/slippery-slope.html) much?
i never got into mars volta, but keep hearing their name again and again from people who love vastly different genres of music from electro to metal.

where should i start?
frankly, i'm not impressed. there's way too much going on at once. it sounds like mush.
thanks for reminding me about those guys. i think ill go on a kinks downloading spree right now.
have you been to one of his shows? it's incredible.
yes, i have. he had the 13 piece band; it was incredible. 
this dude makes me feel old... this and scream-o

though i admit, his live shows look fun, and the kids are way into it. 
it took me a few viewings to realise that too.

[here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf0-wgbrqes) quite an interesting 'making of' video that shows the structure of it...
in this instance, i have to disagree.  the elements of the songs are too similar in too many respects; i'm betting satriani will win his case.  

however, i think there's another point that's not being mentioned enough: i don't think it's fair to assume that coldplay *intentionally* ripped off the song.  

they may have heard it one time, and then later when they were writing thought they were coming up with an original idea.  
damn indeed lol. i'm saying that more so to snorting a shit town of lsd really i guess. i can't even imagine that. trip to hell and... possibly not back lol. i wonder how they were afterwards. 
toootally. future islands and teeth mountain, yeah? i dare say it was one of the best shows i've ever been to, and i've been to some good'uns.
people do that all the time, it's called covering a song or using samples.  but in both cases, you have to credit the original artist and pay them royalties or licensing fees. 

unless, you just want to give away the song/album for free.  
most impressive.
i love how patton seemed to start giving a shit after that solo.

awesome video though, amazes me that they can still sound so great live after all this time.

great, thanks! didn't know it was michel gondry's, [not really a surprise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0hsd_i2dva) when you think about it, i have a dvd with a "making of" for the daft punk one and it's much the same idea.
reminds me of the [pachelbel rant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdxkvqy7qlm).
it borrows a musical motif and lyrics. i couldn't find a studio version on youtube. i believe i found 4+ live versions. but i can say with confidence that if soad played that on an album, they would owe floyd royalties.

if you're not going to go all the way and cover the song, then i think all you're doing is borrowing cachet to make yourself seem broader musically or maybe cooler.

i'll admit, i'm biased. i love floyd and hate them.
i linked to it below, at least a shitty youtube version.

and that is a great point. maybe anything that leads the kids by the hand to floyd's doorstep is for the greater good.
vibe and atmosphere can add to or detract from the experience, but for me it's about improvisation and musical exploration.  i love phish because the jams can go in any direction at any time -- spiritual, rockin, ambient, funky, weird, electronic....  every show is an opportunity to hear something totally new.
i was expecting a cover of the old bowie/ziggy stardust tune.  /sad

sidenote: faith no more does a wicked cool version of the commodores song easy (like sunday morning).
i agree with you but i want to make two points.

first of all, gilmour's solo albums are much better than water's.

second, to me "the wall" actually starts a downhill slide where waters wasn't allowing anyone else nearly as much creative input. "the wall" is a great album but the three that preceded it, "dark side of the moon", "wish you were here", and "animals" are all vastly better. in fact, i'd put these three albums up against any other bands best three albums. any band. ever.

and the album that came afterwards "the final cut" might as well be a waters solo album. it is very inconsistent and mediocre.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klt_hu8bhfc&amp;feature=related
even computer controlled i could swear it missed a couple notes, that and/or it was just a shitty song.
no references to big butts.
i liked phish a little- until i listened to them on shrooms and their music merged with reality.

now, if i don't like them, i cease to be.
upvoted because today is my birthday. 
that one gets an upvote too! :) 
wonderful track. i loved when they used this in a [fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdof-s7iux4&amp;feature=related) sequence on 'the boondocks'.


i'm not an expert on copyright law but it seems to me there should be two pieces of an infringement claim.  first that the songs are too similar, and second that they are similar because the later work was a rip off of the first.

this video only only tries to discuss whether the songs are similar, but it seems to me that it would be quite obvious to anyone that they are, subdominant chord substitutions or no.  the only interesting part of the case is whether it can be (dis)proved that coldplay had the opportunity to copy the satriani song
go see dan deacon live!

especially on this tour with the live ensemble.  it's a great.  amazing energy, fun fun fun.

and i'm a cranky old man who hates dancing.  the energy at a dan deacon show is infectious.

edit:

otayyo reminded me that there's an all songs considered recording of one of the early shows with the ensemble:

[dan deacon live at the 9:30 club, may 17, 2009](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=104056205)
this is the song before it was what youve already heard. i used to play with these guys till about a year ago when i moved. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ywvsr9jspa
the guy whos playing bass in the video now has his own band, which is awesome. http://www.myspace.com/detrivores
im totally doing that, right now.
"deloused in the comatorium" is probably the best to start off with.

i greatly enjoyed seeing them live. twice.
it can!  i'd buy an album buy these guys in a heart beat.  amazing
i'm a little jealous of the teens that are just discovering this (and other good older stuff) and just beginning to realize that a ton of actually cool stuff came out before or around the time they were born

//i hate lawns
what about friend of the devil? 
well, judging by their beats, it did go mainstream, about 15 years ago.
balitmore, wham city, represent! natty bohs for all!
upvoted.  nobody else sounds like the band.  they sound like country musicians playing jazz.
it is indeed, but i'm still searching for the best one i've ever *heard*.
bad brains pwn. 
&gt;and the album that came afterwards "the final cut" might as well be a waters solo album. it is very inconsistent and mediocre.

matter of taste. i think it's their best effort regardless of it being a purely waters focused album. but it probably resonates with me more because i am a child of the 80's.
uhh, going mainstream is a bad thing.
exactly, because coldplay wouldn't even *know* about satriani since he's an ego douche look at my fingers guitar player.
they lifted the chord progression from *the carpenters* and i now need to hear "close to you"...
why do birds suddenly appear, every time, you are near?
neat question.

but but...sometimes you get a jackinthbox malt out of it, i've been there man.

the insane profits that can be made from mass destruction.

go read the book 'merchants of death' (1934) for some very insightful history of the latter 19thc and early 20thc war machine and its methods.

btw the books also covers in some detail the rise of the third reich and connections to western arms companies who armed and supported hitler.

theres a lot of forgotten history in this book, key players from the scandals of the early depression and the disarmament and rearmament of the 20s/30s.

some of the facts of poison gas warfare are very interesting, details that have been twisted and reinvented by ww2 onwards 'historians' , the ratio of poison gas production is very telling. 8 to 1 on one sides favour.

read this book and understand where the 30s pacifists came from, it wasn't just ivory tower rose coloured glassed ideology, but cold calculated facts. 

the human race collectively has learned nothing from ww1 or ww2 or any of the big wars.

i didn't hear any mention of their neighborhood being remarkably difficult to live in, the fact that they deal drugs, that they have shot and killed numerous people, the number of women that they have relations with on a regular basis, or anything about how said women compliment their sexual talents.
because mainstream music sucks from and genre 
i don't believe it should be legal for one artist to sue another artist for having a similar song. this is the same kind of reasoning as with file sharing. information should be free to all. if one artist can take from another artist and make something good, then what's the problem? i think we need to rethink this idea of 'owning' information. this is just as fucked up as the pharmacoms copyrighting genes. it's a fucking cord progression for fuck' sake.

only if you want to remain poor.
it's difficult for me to argue that all information should be free to all, but i'm working on that. however, as far as creative information like music goes: it should be free because it is not a product of any individual, but is really an indirect product of society. no artist operates outside the society. when anyone makes music they are always influenced by information that came before, or by contemporary information.

the question being raised in this situation is where do we draw the line between influence and theft. i think that line is completely arbitrary, and like all arbitrary lines should be abandoned.

again, i'm sorry i have no good argument for why all information, without exception, should be free. i feel that this is true, but i don't know why yet. so maybe i shouldn't have said that.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heavy_metal_(movie)

the film enjoyed only limited appeal in its initial run, but became a popular cult attraction for midnight theatrical showings, much like the rocky horror picture show. legal problems with the film's music rights kept it off the commercial home video market for 15 years, although it did make rotation on cable movie channels like hbo and cinemax allowing for fans to record it. in 1996, the legal issues were resolved and the film is now generally available. heavy metal may be the canonical example of a popular film or album that was unavailable to consumers for a long time for obscure reasons, despite popular acclaim or success.


yesyesyes!
seeing the pink floyd link reminded me of this. it's got to be one of the most uplifting songs i keep in heavy rotation.
cause it sucks
no one seems to be mentioning they produced some of the coolest music and live improvisation ever. they had an extended peak from 93 to 98 where they were just phenomenally creative live. the completely changed styles over that time period multiple times as well.  they still play very well (much better than some previous years) so the shows are still fun.
you're a gay hippie
you can catch a live recording of one of those shows on a npr: all songs considered podcast. fantastic.
because they are unique, extremely talented, and transcend genres... at times, the group can work together and really feel the music in ways that few other bands can. it is difficult to explain without going to a show and getting the full experience. hearing just a few of their songs will not tell you what phish is and what phish isn't.
i posted this to watmm just yesterday but i think i made the entry too vanilla since very few people appear to have seen it. so here you go... all comments appreciated!

mainstream is dead
db to eb7 you mean? i don't understand. 
this sounds pretty cool. anyone know any more music like this? classical mixed with hiphop? preferably with no vocals. 
do you know of any other artists with really similar styles?  i just discovered this guy the other day and was really impressed with the way he does his music.  anything similar would be awesome.
hip hop is dead, it's in a stage of transformation.  wait 5 years and see what's happening in the mainstream, i'm sure it will be pretty out there.  there's not really anywhere to go but somewhere bizarre and awesome, these days.
there are vocals but, try nuttin' but strings (artist name).  and there is such a beast as trip hop which is to an extent instrumental hip hop.  check out the ninja tunes record label.  one of my favorite trip hop artists is blockhead.  he uses many classical samples in his music.
wow thanks! the greatest favor to me is to listen to my music, and i really do appreciate it.
re: fwd: [repost][repost][repost][repost][repost] violin + dj
black violin
hip hop isn't dead, mainstream hip hop is just terrible. and in 5 years, mainstream music will probably be what it's been for the past 5 years...and the 20, maybe 30 years before that: a rotting cesspool of mass-produced horse shit posing as art--and failing miserably.
i listened long enough to hear some roots and gnarles barkley. the violin is playing the missing vocal tracks and whatnot. still awesome though.
black violin is dope.  if you're looking even more mainstream-ish check out miri ben-ari.
r.i.p. jay dee
ninja tunes are not really a trip hop label. they have a couple of trip hop like tunes but they really are a drum and bass label.

for trip hop [downtempo breakbeat] check out...
- massive attack
- portishead
- dynamo productions
- day one

and thats just the bristol boys :)

the label to really focus on though for trip hop is [the sadly no more] grand central. some of the arrtists from there that you may have heard of are

- rae and christian
- aim
- tony d

hope that helps
also no mention of settling a disagreement with fisticuffs.
or artistically credible.
if grammernazi saw this...
you know, i'd never actually heard the original version of that song.  i heard it on girltalk, and always thought it was amusing, but never knew anything about the original.

thank you for opening my eyes.
reminds me a bit of [rjd2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6qgbnpunju&amp;feature=related).

also reminds me of atmosphere.  i swear, hip-hop doesn't get much better than atmosphere, imo.
mine is rachmaninoff's 3rd piano concerto in d minor.
this is one of those songs that just pop into my head and always gets me in a good mood. two thumbs (and one orange arrow) up.
this is the most awesome thing i've heard all week.
an example for why popular music should advance artistically to prevent duplicates?
yeah excellent submission!

i normally dont like it that there are so many youtube submissions in this subreddit, but this was excellent - i hope it gets picked up amongst all the other shit that is posted.
yeah, getting on a big record label and having them control what you make is artistically credible. being on a indie label does not make you mainstream ever. 
research jonny greenwood. he's a fellow geek in the realm of music.
it does you just don't dig.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsmgvjawea0
ninja tune has a large variety of artists that make a large variety of music.  still ninja tune is without a doubt the biggest label in trip hop today followed by warp, anticon, and xl; none of which are strictly trip hop they just happen to host big talent.  those artists you named, while excellent and prime examples of trip hop, are fairly outdated in my opinion.  bristol is where it started but it definitely didn't stay there.  there really is no big strictly trip hop label anymore.
yep, good points well made. i was not trying to piss on your fire, but point the original poster to a label [and artists] that were almost exclusively trip hop.
definitely some black eyed peas in there...
the last thing in the world 'mainstream' wants these days is originality.  far too great a business risk.  mainstream artists are now all carefully fabricated, molded, focus group studied creations.  corporate shit to feed the masses, they'll listen because they don't know any better.
&gt; yeah, getting on a big record label and having them control what you make is artistically credible.

not sure what you're trying to say here. are you being sarcastic? if so you're agreeing with me. or did you phrase it incorrectly? or do you actually believe that?

&gt; being on a indie label does not make you mainstream ever.

pretty sure this was sarcasm, but either way, being on an indie label doesn't necessarily mean you have artistic credibility. being unpopular doesn't mean you have artistic credibility. it's easier to say who *doesn't* have artistic credibility than who does. someone who creates something for the sole purpose of mass consumption and profit doesn't.

i'm not saying that everything that is popular was made for the sole purpose of making money. there are always a few gems built on an attempt to actually create some form of art. what i'm saying is that in today's market it is incredibly difficult--and unlikely--for something to achieve high levels of popularity unless it was produced with the intent of achieving that popularity. therefore, something which has "gone mainstream" is, more often than not, created with this purpose in mind. so even if, early in the creation process, there was some artistic thought going into it, that is usually lost by the time the finished product is released.
great band.
thank you, i will say that it does require repeated listenings based on responses i get from most people.
because you can't sell it to stupid white kids who want to be black.
artists are better. i guess i was lazy :) besides blockhead try amon tobin, bonobo, and omega one.

that wasn't a violin btw check out viola.
it isn't classical. it's blue note (jazz). blue note is well known for being massively sampled since the inception of hip-hop in the mid 80s. unless you were only talking about the violin, which is folk. :d
beautiful voice.  way better than the original. 
well it's mainly with vocals but there are some instrumental only remixes. pete philly &amp; perquisite, hip hop with a real cello. (they also played with the metropole orchestra)
because garbage like "hyphy" exists...
i was looking for that after seeing the actual movie, thanks :)
hahah hilarious enough, we just went on a tiny little break....indefinately.....but thank you!  perhaps i could send you a cd?
why do you think it was a viola?  or are those two people 6 foot 9?
amazing someone would downvote you saying what music you like. both are great, especially mastodon.
applying copyright to chord progressions is just as retarded as applying patents to algorithms. basically you are trying to assign ownership of patterns that arise naturally from mathematics.

what makes a song unique and is worth copyrighting is the whole that arises from building on top of the chord progression: time signatures and accents, melodies, choice of instruments, how the instruments are played (dynamics), effects, ambient sounds, vocal style, singer voice, overall song structure and pacing, tempo, rhythm/accents/time signatures, ....

starting with the same chord progression and even with the same tempo, you can still create two songs so completely different that they'll be completely unrecognizable without studying them in depth.

now, i haven't listened to coldplay's or satriani's recent stuff in ages so i don't know if the particular case warrants a plagiarism claim, but just having the same chord progression and tempo does not.

they're pretty good. i was a phish hater for a little while as i didn't know anyone who listened to them untilt he farmhouse album came out. i started listening, liked it. wound up seeing them a few times, got some live shows bootlegged. good stuff. now i get hated on for being the only phish fan i know just about... the song that made me a huge fan was, well it's two, okay three. two live covers, one of "seems to me(walk away)" by joe walsh, and another of "rock n roll" by lou reed. also their studio/album version of "heavy things". phish is pretty damn good.
i have a question.  is this really hip-hop? i would guess it's an amazingly talented violinist with a dj laying down some tracks in the back ground. not really hip-hop, but i really don't listen to hip-hop.
i'm confused. are you suggesting we throw out our previous statistic, and instead base it on the mean this time instead of the median?

hip hop is more to do with the kind of beat structure, than the total composition of the music.

you can technically say 'no it isn't hip-hop, it doesn't have any vocals' but it's as close as you can get. as someone said earlier, the violin is the replacement for the vocals.
geert vilain is a singer-songwriter who works in ghent, in flanders (the dutch speaking part of belgium)... but is he also a serial killer who sings about his passion that kills? free downloads, creepy soundscapes and dark gothic folk music of the online murder and mystery game!
well, the strings are only playing two notes (an eb in the bass and a db higher up), so the chord is ambiguous. by looking at the key we could guess eb7, but if you play it through with that chord it doesn't sound right.

in my opinion it's absus4/eb, but that's just what sounds right to me.
[whisper]

everyone copies everyone. it's inevitable.
nice.  i'm digging that groove.  
right, why would anyone upvote such a senseless comment?
hip-hop doesn't need vocals. see material by dj shadow, rjd2, nujabes, dan the automator.
to be fair - hip-hop is leaps and bounds the most original genre in the mainstream at the moment (kinda like winning the special olympics, i know). but at least around where i live, i am way more inclined to put on a mainstream hip-hop/rap station than a rock one. mainstream rock nowadays is the epitome of molded, generic, "safe" music - stuff like the fray, nickelback, coldplay - complete mind-numbing garbage. hip-hop on the other hand is all about staying fresh, even the stuff on the mainstream. you may not like it because it doesn't sound like 2pac or biggie, but rap is always evolving, changing, and always introducing new techniques and styles (more so than just about any other genre in my honest opinion and i pay attention to a lot of music).
why can't hip-hop just die already?
ninjatune's great - i'd also recommend coldcut, the herbalizer, kid koala, mr. scruff, up, bustle and out, wagon christ etc.

atmosphere is cool. have you ever listened to army of the pharaohs or jedi mind tricks?
i was meaning the volta, me and electro go way back. :-) 

for depeche mode remixes, check out the razormaid remix of "enjoy the silence" and the dave clark "accoustic version" of "dream on". i also think kruder &amp; dorfmeister have a few remixes on their albums, which i highly recommend. 
what a fantastic band
of all these videos, the alizee was the most enjoyable. 

oh, and if you're comparing musical structure, i think the alizee song is the most similar. 
try de-loused in the comatorium or frances the mute, they're both great albums. cygnus... vismund cygnus is one of my favorite songs of all time.
why would you want it to go mainstream, what's the point? do you enjoy music differently when you know there's more people listening to it? there's two people on that video making music, there's you enjoying it ... what more do you need?

then again, you can't go more mainstream than [miri ben-ari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irexfdfg7aw#t=0m15s).

she has done a lot of stuff with all the mainstream artists but i really enjoyed her album ["the hip-hop violinist"](http://www.amazon.com/hip-hop-violinist-miri-ben-ari/dp/b000a7q1qk).

even had some of her songs in one of my [mixes](http://cd7.planet.ee/mus/mix2/).
if it's mainstream your more likely to hear it at party's, you get more imitators, some of whom may be good and also do something original with it, it would get these guys touring, so the op may get to see it, it would give them a budget to make more music, and probably much more.

music being popular (mainstream may be the best word) gives a tremendous boost to that music. music that noone listens to goes away.

besides that, it's an interesting question. why didn't this become mainstream? i don't really know the answer (besides marketing, but one would think that marketing the stuff people like better would be easier and less resource intensive).
simply put... because it's isn't marketable enough.  you hear it and you think "hey, i recognize those songs... that's kinda cool."  but the moment these two would star performing original tracks it loses the familiarity and gets boring.  

get a guy on turntables with a small array of classical instruments and you're getting warmer.
true, but i still believe that to be more turntablism than hip-hop, purely because it's showcasing the skills they have in using the turntable + samplers.

no doubt the collaborations they have done, such as dj shadow with j5 (quannum spectrum) and rjd2 with blueprint (soul position), are hip hop, but i wouldn't call their beats alone 'hip-hop' as a whole.

not that you're wrong, i just feel it's better this way.
mainstream is now targeted at people who buy cd's, children. it used to be 18-35 now it's 14 and under.
also,  it was blatantly missing references to conspicuous consumption, lifestyle adertising, and autotune. 
the cynic in me says that calling this hip-hop has more to do with the ethnicity of the performers then the music they're playing. as good as the guy is, classical strings over a beat has been done a fair amount before.

you could call it classical/hip-hop, i guess, but the usual problem such music faces is the cross-over market is so niche. the classical fans prefer it without the beat, and the hip-hop fans prefer it without the violin.
because it's not hip hop. it's violin music with a rock/hip-hip influenced backbeat. but this doesn't catch on because there are no lyrics. people are usually interested in someone saying something in their pop songs.

that's not to say that this won't catch on in a niche contest. but it's not going to "go mainstream."

btw i think the short cover of "crazy" actually illustrates how most people sell hip hop short. there's an actual melody there!
what a load of horse shit.
yeah and what with this "rock" music?? i just want to listen to frank sinatra forever
thank god we didnt have to hear those scary black people talk
because people enjoy seeing good music rewarded.
but hip-hop also has a lot to do with what the people are saying, as well as the rhyme structure of how they're saying it.

really, "hip-hop" beats were just originally stolen from funk, rock, and jazz beats, so really if you have something like this, the most you can say is that it's "hip-hop beats" or "hip-hop inspired."
no, they'll listen because the record companies are choosing safe bets. if they go out on a limb for an original sounding act, it'll be because they've already gotten popular without the record companies. then, to stay safe, they'll go out and get every band that sounds like them. it's very much like how hollywood always makes tons of remakes and sequels.
hm, sounds more like you are equating rap with hip-hop music, which is just not the case. turntablism is one *technique of hip-hop*, just as rap or beatboxing is. it isn't something separate. if you really wish, we can call turntablism a sub-genre of hip-hop, but it is still hip-hop.
where's the autotune..?  and the shitty beats..?

yo man, i didn't see no strippers, bling, cash money, rims, curse words, pimpin or weed. technically it doesn't qualify.
fucking great song. i've loved them for a good six years or so...they're amazing live too.
because it involves talent?

before i get downmodded into oblivion, know that i thoroughly enjoyed listening to that video. i just have no respect for a genre whos' mainstream music consists of a beat my computer can generate with free software, and some words. i'm a guitarist with little taste for lyrics. that violinist (in my opinion) out-talented all the original groups he covered in one video. that, i respect.
a fair point. i think we can just leave this here as arguing this is going to go nowhere except 'i'm right you're wrong'. upvoted you for a good set of points.
and it didn't even involve frightened parental units relocating their children to upscale neighborhoods in southern california and the resulting vehicular transportation of the affected party.
&gt;i’m more into the real hip hop, you know?  krs one, del tha funkee homosapien, de la soul, wu tang, you know, the old school.

it's funny cus its true.  i saw del up here in boston a few years ago and it was all white college kids (which i am as well).  not that there's anything wrong with that, but i was expecting a little more variety in the crowd, but i guess deltron 3030 has a pretty limited audience...
which is why you market to people who think it sounds bad-ass. they're usually outside of the classical and hip-hop markets.
&gt;how said women compliment their sexual talents.

at first, i accidentally read that as "how said women *complement* their sexual talents.
wonderful improvisational talent!
yes, i agree completely... no sarcasm. i have a hard time listening to anything on major record labels knowing that the artist did not have full artistic control in making their album.
oh, snap! did i just get _(34°05'00"n,118°26'52"w)_'d?
because simon cowell has better ideas.
&gt;i am dating myself.

are you thinking of tying the knot anytime soon?
fd: fwd: fw: fwd: fwd: re: fwd: [repost][repost][repost][repost][repost] violin + dj (forward this on or you'll die in five days!)
yeah, but when rjd2 teams up with a vocal artist, it's *super* awesome.
have you heard/seen anything by mix master mike?  you might like that because he can actually do some awesome things with just one turntable.  take these clips for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw2e1kgykcw 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6igexp7pn8&amp;feature=related

there surely is some talent there because a lot of times he has to find where the hits are on the record.  so similar to how a violin must know exactly where to press his or her fingers, which has no fretmarks, mm mike must be able to find the appropriate sound.  
why does it have to go mainstream?

tto sell plastic bits in stores? why not sell digital bits online? only the latter gets my business anyways.

or maybe he does already... http://pauldateh.com/music/

if you have such an ability a bright future in the music industry awaits you. :p
awesome. i've considered buying from his vineyard before, but just have never gotten around to it. here is his site - though nothing is for sale during the summers: http://www.caduceus.org/
and tribe sampled minnie ripperton - baby, this love i have.

i'll add it to my site; sampledsongs.com as soon as i get a chance.
from gene himself.


getting lots of attention re: adam lambert.
i'm surprised. and ultimately, don't think what i have to say about the subject is all that important. but just for the record:
let's set the record straight.

1. lambert is very talented and would be great in queen, or a similar group....or (yes) on broadway. i said and still hold to my comments - he should have won american idol. period.
2. i also stand by my previous comment - lambert's voice does not sound like a rocker's voice. that's neither good, nor bad.
freddie mercury didn't have a rocker voice either. which sort of means, mercury might have been the wrong voice to sing songs like satisfaction or jumpin' jack flash in the stones...and likewise, jagger might have sounded strained singing bohemian rhapsody in queen.
lambert has a mercury type voice.
he would sound good in queen and (yes!!!) on broadway.
3. i stand by my assessment that's it's a mistake (at this early stage of his career) to out himself.
believe me, it's a big mistake.
i hope for lambert's sake, i'm completely wrong. but i believe this may impede his career.
not everyone lives in la, and not everyone wants to deal with private issues.
main talking points seem to be lambert's sexual preferences, instead of his talent.
and that's a career killer.
4. in either case, whatever i say, or you say, means nothing.
he will do as he pleases...and more power to him.
5. finally, for the record - i've always supported (publicly and privately) gay rights, women's rights, minority rights...hell...anyone's rights to lead life as they like...and have full opportunity..
but that doesn't mean a career will work as effectively if you disclose everything about yourself even before you release your first product.
i would have waited, if i were lambert, until i was rich and famous.
and, what i think means nothing. i wouldn't offer my opinion unless asked.
and i was asked.

we will see.
it's a violin.  check your facts before you start correcting people.

he's not putting adam down; nor is he criticizing adam's lifestyle. he's just saying he thinks that the timing of "his coming out" is a mistake for his career. 

gene has been nothing but gung ho for adam since after the show, "saying he should have won, etc. etc". gene's basically saying that adam's announcement may have a negative impact on his career; despite the fact that his sexual preference has no bearing on how talented he is.

edit: "won" instead of "one"...*sigh*
turntablism/djing is actually one of the 
[four elements of hip hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_elements_of_hip_hop#cultural_pillars).

along with mcing (rapping, spoken word), breakdancing, and writing (graffiti). :)

edited to add link
quite welcome. thought of another suggestion:

[ray lamontagne' *you are the best thing*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itx3-cbwnm)

see, i'm barely a minute into that first video and loving it. i love club/trance/(good)techno and the like... it's the pure bland-ness that makes up 99% of mainstream hip-hop and rap that turns me off to that genre in specific. i'm liking mike.
love mm mike and turntablism in general, but what turns me off is the sophomoric goofiness and the psuedo-psychadelia of, for example, the [invisibl skratch piklz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invisibl_skratch_piklz).
&gt;this is going to go nowhere except 'i'm right you're wrong'. 

as a third party let me interject and state that you are incorrect.  hip-hop requires no lyrics what so ever, and this video is hip-hop to a t.  

hip hop just refers to the musical styling that came out of nyc in the 70's and expanded from there.  the etymology of this video is clearly rooted in that.
he's totally criticizing adam's lifestyle. he's giving the old homophobe line about "if we say it's ok for men to have sex, it's a slippery slope to saying people can fuck animals"... that's an argument from the anti-gay marriage ignoramuses. 

fuck gene simmons. if you talk about your sex life but other people can't talk about theirs, you're a fucking hypocrite. fuck you gene, why don't you try and write a new song instead of putting on makeup and living off the past. you're not a musician, you're a fucking novelty act.
i didn't get that from reading it. i thought he said he really could careless about what people do in their private life. he added the farm animals to counter the slippery slope that homophobes would use against him.
bullshit.
gene has always stood behind the idea that what people do with each other is fair game as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.
if he's such a homophobe, why would he do this onstage...

http://kissfaq.com/forum09/files/77_08_25_los_angeles_california_lynn_goldsmith_photo_session_b02_161.jpg

xsvfan was right, it is a counter against homophobe would use against him.

you are shooting off your mouth about things you know nothing about.

he talks because people ask.

new song... kiss is going to have a new album out this sept. (tentatively).

he plays bass, piano, guitar, knows 6 languages, toured the world over.

no, he is an entertainer. kiss is more than a band, they're a brand.
one of my favorite bands too.  i love them.
me too, played them at my wedding
has he ever told a straight guy to shut up about his sexual preferences? does he use that standard for himself... "just go shut up and sing?" no.
eh, i had a different experience.

a couple of years ago (2005? 2006?) i went to a show at sxsw in austin that was lady sovereign opening for ghostface (but several other members of wu tang showed up, and it was pretty much just a wu-tang show).

the place was sold out for lady sovereign's set, with a bunch of white college radio nerds trying to get in there to check her out, but after her set the place cleared out, only to slowly fill back up with black folks wanting to see ghostface.

for the record, ghostface et al was about 100 times better.

wine sales almost tripled in the last 15 years and there's niche markets for everything.  it's like bottling money whose main ingredient is water.

doc looks interesting.  the music and wine business similarities are amusing.  

best maynard song eva:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljvvxes1_pe
ennio morricone, fuck yeah!
despite at one time blogging for wine spectator, i understand mjk has been reluctant to release any of his bottles for review.  the general opinion that i've seen online from amateur oenophiles (not just tool fans) who've drunk his wines is that they are overpriced.  that's not to say that they're bad, people seem to like them, but not *love* them.  although i have yet to read a really good review of the chupacabra (paso robles syrah and cabernet),  the most affordable bottle mjk produces at $25.

if you ever buy a bottle, post a review.  i'd love to hear more about caduceus' arizona appellations (so far, it's just the judith, right?).
when i read this i envision some young, sensitive pa that gene pays to dig him out of the situations he gets into.
it's not like things are prices by how good they are.
that track is off their first cd and imho their best stuff. i remember sitting at cafe i was bout 15 years old and across the street from me in deep ellum texas all hell started breaking loose in the street. traffic stopped i go over to check it out and its ozomatli doing their conga line thing out in the middle of the street. rip deep ellum  
i've been on the zero 7 train for a while now.  two producers who know all about dynamics and analog gear!  their synth sounds are awesome!
maynard's dick is better...no homo...
i love the female vocalist!


i like jedi mind tricks.  i'll check out army of pharaohs.
samplist electronica. i love the bass work.
i think their newest album really shows off slug's ability.  i understand he isn't the greatest rapper, but his ability to tell a story in the song is what makes it so appealing.
yeah, aotp is lead by vinnie paz (same guy in jedi mind) but there is a bunch of other awesome underground dudes in the group (apathy, celph titled, king syze, etc). i also recommend aesop rock, canibus, brother ali, sage francis if you don't know of them already...so much good rap out there. 
not sure yet ;-) i'm going for another couple of listens - this time on some proper speakers with a bit of bass. the 8-bit sound took me by surprise, but i don't dislike it.
need to get to a machine that can uncompress a rar - i'll listen then (monday).

i do keep my promises!

[edit] that sounds lame - i'm not at home, so using random family members computers at the moment...

don't give up when the dummer drinks all your beer and sleeps with your sister - there are always more drummers in the sea...
ah, fun.  i always keep a copy of winrar handy on my flash drive.  :) 

cant wait to hear your thoughts.
that was intense.
flashbacks at work = o_o !!!!
the only disappointing thing about the album was that it was very bookend-ish.  first and last song were some of the best songs i've ever heard, the middle wasn't even close to some of their best stuff.
sometimes they are.  i'm not interested in paying a premium for the novelty of buying a tool wine.  if it doesn't taste good, then it's overpriced - especially considering he wants people to buy $90 bottles from a vineyard in a region not at all known for producing good wine grapes.
this is very good stuff.

however, when i was growing up in the 70s, they called this "easy listening", and it was for old people like my parents.

now i'm pushing 40, and i love it.  so it can't be easy listening, because i don't like that kind of stuff. right?  *right?*

shit.

gonna go listen to my [rust in peace](http://www.megadeth.com/discography.php?era_id=4) cd now.
brother ali is one of my favorites.  aesop rock is also awesome.

pandora is such a great tool.  i just set up an atmosphere channel, and a few hours later, i have a ton of new artists to listen to.
zero 7 is definitely good stuff but you probably shouldn't classify them as "mature pop."  not only would they probably not like it, but their stuff leans much closer to lounge/chillout or trip-hop.  if you're a fan of them, air or supreme beings of leisure might be up your alley too.
i was suggesting that it's priced by what people are (possibly) willing to pay for it.
yup, i found zero 7 when i first heard "in the waiting line", which i made my phone ringtone for a while.  then i bought "the garden" cd, which is very good and has a lot of songs with interesting vocals and non-orthodox hooks.

it's good stuff, just slightly off-mainstream.
i am nothing if not curious. what exactly do you take issue with? i believe that while my description is crude, it fits the target audience of mainstream hip-hop - suburban white youth.
yup, they happen to be great live as well. nice choice.
i'm curious as to whether or not these wines will specifically enhance other things more than conventional wines.  certain sacred and/or metaphysical rituals, for example.
well you know they have to be damn serious and disciplined to achieve that level of talent, so why would it turn you off for them to have fun with it?
word.  a lot of people don't realize that hip-hop exists beyond the music.


"thou shalt remember that guns, bitches and bling were never part of the four elements and never will be."

clicked on a whim, and for once i'm glad i did.

not bad.
well at least hooker with a penis has already been written.
was kurt cobain "rewarded" by his success?

zero 7 are awesome. i love their music, but the vocals are just as enthralling.
i dig brother ali too.  also sage francis.

thievery corporation too.

for jazz hip-hop fusion, check out guru's jazzmatazz.  highly recommended.

yeah...if you're into that kind of thing. too slow for my taste. 
add blockhead to that list.
jerome, az is one of the coolest towns i have played in the world.

there is a dive bar called the spirit room that is just an awesome place to play. then partying with all the locals till the sun rises over the sedona valley area is amazing.
&gt; for the record, ghostface et al was about 100 times better.

i don't think that needed any clarification. 
have been listening to them for years.  used to use this as music while i was sleeping and would result in some fantastically crazy dreams.
[martin luther king sings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0f4ixezoqy)
hahaha, if you only knew how far from possible that would be :d thanks again for the kind words.
really?  seemed to me like the first 4-5 tracks were solid.  but to each their own  ^.^
you must be trolling.
great, great song. i wished they played it when they came, but they played ramones and nirvana instead. fair enough.
if you like zero 7 (like me), check out [air](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh5bl_xbo64) who came way before z7. 




their song "today" was on "the boys and girls guide to getting down" soundtrack...that song was made for sparkin &amp; chillin out
i agree with you about kiss, except for ace frehley. he's a borderline great guitarist who's been very influential.

but gene simmons? irrelevant.
being a brand doesn't make you "more than a band". it makes you less than one.
"bad (live)" by u2 from wide awake in america
thanks! watching gene kelly always puts me in a good mood.
he was, but he was too depressed to take the stress of it. the poor guy had an addiction.
"good morning good morning" and "good day sunshine" by the beatles
the genre is "downtempo." also, the singer sia left the band and made her own stuff. you can look that up too. also, you might like thievery corporation or buddha bar.
why yes, zero 7 is an amazing band.  tends to be very accessible music at parties or kick backs-- people always ask "who is this that's playing?."

as another user pointed out, they are often categorized in downtempo/chillout/trip-hop.

enjoy :)
oh. oh baby. this is like buttah. *nice!*
yeah, it would sound great on an advert.
looks like a really well made documentary, good looking trailer anyway.
[fortunate son - ccr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec0xkhahr5i)
it's excellent. similar to portishead, morcheeba, lamb, and to a lesser extent nightmares on wax, thievery corporation, and tricky.
rarely does good music go mainstream.
"all white people believe that they prefer listening to jazz over watching television.  this is not true."

as a white person, i can say definitively that i prefer jazz to television. i get so bored with television that i don't watch it anymore. at all.

pro tip: unfocus your eyes like you're looking at one of those magic eye posters.
i've read speculation that mjk is trying to price tool fans out of the market for the wine so only serious wine drinkers will buy his juice.
there was a point in the uk around 2002 where you couldn't go to a "dinner party" without hearing zero 7. some of comedians based a few sketches around this. 
see also: lemon jelly, avalanches, mono &amp; kinobe. and everyone knows massive attack. 
uh, no, i actually want to know if certain vintages he's made will [achieve more than just tasting good](http://www.toolband.com/news/letter/2002_03.php).  most tool fans know the level of interest the band members have in metaphysics.
i saw them live for their second album, and i have to say it was probably the best concert i have ever seen.  the vocalists were incredible.  unfortunately they change vocalists each album.
i'm a fan of tool, but seriously: a dude decided to start a vineyard. this really isn't novel enough to warrant a doc. and face it: it's an infomercial!
i liked zero 7 a few years ago, but found them utterly boring when compared to other electronic music like boards of canada and aphex twin, etc. i discovered boc about 5 years ago, and i can't listen to any other electronic stuff, it just sounds so amateurish.
i think air properly started off the whole singing over electronic music thing, and now everyone's doing it.

boc really blew me away, i listen to it everyday, it's one of the best things i've ever heard.

yes! polvo fan here. i had no idea they were coming out with a new album! i knew they had reuinted -drummer last year and played a few gigs. unfortunately i couldn't make it to atp at minehead uk. it was curated by explosions in the sky, awesome lineup in general :(

i think i have most of their cds... i'm missing exploded drawing and perhaps their first ep, but i do have an original copy of todays active lifestyles with the red lions on the cover, and the poster that came with it!

you are so unique.

boc completely changed what was happening in electronic music back in '98.  music has the right to children was a real game changer.  they've been imitated so much in the last decade it's pretty tough to listen to them with fresh ears.
jock jams
it's a fucking [air](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlv7s5uzsue) rip off.
fuck adverts
sarcasm my friend. their music has been used on a ton of ads in the uk.
that song was in the movie garden state. which is a great movie, a lot of it has to do with the awesome soundtrack. the zero 7 song they used was perfect where they used it.
shame they sold out.
fuck this is amazing. i have only listened to skeletal lamping previously, i'm totally getting the album from which this song comes now.
[here are some of my tracks](http://www.thesixtyone.com/sorenvinson1)
i welcome any feedback...
i honestly consider "when it falls" to be a better album in my book, though "the garden" is quite good.

the first time i heard "home" was the first time i'd ever listened to music, ahem, "altered".  my friend played it, and the bass swell under each of the "-one" sounding words in the chorus just blew me away.  it's still one of my favorite songs.
its a viola
*hissing fauna...* is a much better album, less gay.

this song signifies the main character's transition from regular guy to georgie fruit, his black transvestite alter-ego. so skeletal lamping is heavily written from georgie's point of view ("we can do it softcore if you want, but don't you know that i go both ways" and "i'm a muthafuckin headline and bitch you don't even know it")...and the only way to describe it in comparison to the previous album is...more gay.
no structure, just mindfuck.
at least they played gronlandic edit?
welcome to 2002. and since we have learned that it is shit.
i have been up to page springs cellars several times. the last time we helped pick grapes. eric spent some time with us, he is a really nice guy. i highly recommend visiting, we had a great time. here are some pics http://www.flickr.com/photos/52451337@n00/sets/72157611214167622/ http://www.flickr.com/photos/52451337@n00/sets/72157607416980424/
even though i posted the article, i agree as well. i don't see how this documentary is going to be more than 30 minutes. 
i think it will be an interesting story but, obviously, if maynard wasn't at the core of it, the movie could never be made.  however, to say that it's an infomercial is ludicrous.  the wines have been scoring very high (for years), earned a lot of respect and are frequently sold out.  the dude doesn't need the attention to sell his wines, trust me.  finally, anyone that knows tool, and especially maynard, knows that they are far from shameless self-promoters, shying away from all but a rare few interviews.
direct inspiration for zero 7 (imo) comes from [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rng1zzrqpmg&amp;feature=related)
dont give a shit
any more recomendations?
i bought two bottles of chupacabra at a wine signing in satown a couple months back.  one of the bottles my parents drank without permission; they "thought it was a gift" to them lol

the other bottle was consumed in one night by yours truly.  dry and with a good flavor but hardly worth the bucks.   i wouldn't stand in line for three hours again just to be rushed past maynard like a head of cattle, either
thuth up. i thonth no. maybe becauth i thpeak like thith...
try david sylvian's work if you like this. it's a similar vibe but with a little more of an adventurous spirit.
they are in a lineage with the likes of black dog, plaid, autechre, and artists from labels like mo' wax, ninja tune, and warp. there are so many good electronic artists in the world that it's a bit myopic at best, disrespectful at worst to say that boc are the end all be all. i can say that with full respect to boc as i own almost all of their output.
yea, i think it really depends on what aphex twin you are listening to as well.... there is some really good stuff that totally changed electronic music (and puts zero 7 to shame) and then there is some stuff that is meh.

if you wanna hear aphex at its best, check out the "richard d. james" album or the "come to daddy" ep for some frantic stuff, or selected ambient works disc for some really great ambient.  

or, if you just want some youtube recomendations, look up "come to daddy", "film", or "girl/boy song".  

really though, aphex is a very different beast than zero 7, but much stronger, in my opinion....
what's wrong with mature pop? i like mature pop.
there's this new documantary, out called "anvil". it's about this heavy metal group that had quite a following, but never went anywhere. the reason (i think)) this film will be a hit is because so many artists can relate. music is the most fickle of businesses. some really good stuff gets overlooked while garbage gets all the promotion. 


i listened to your cuts, and the only advice i can give you is to drop the "hand claps". it's so 80's. never give up trying though.
back in the days on the boulevard of linden....

denali and glos are both bands she's in with her brother keeley from engine down &amp; sparta. denali broke up, but there was a reunion show last year, so who knows...


in the age of super boredom, hype, and mediocrity, celebrate relentlessness and menace to society.
wow!! that looks.... boring as fuck. get over yourself maynard.
wow.  this just made me realize how much of a no-talent ass-clown i am.
woah, woah! i went to your site and i'm checking out "20 years". you're amazing. seriously.

where can i buy this? please tell me it's on rhapsody etc.
if i want grown folks music, sade is my choice. 
jawhol!
one of my favorite tunes of theirs.
and definitely the most danceable ...
yeah, i missed atp, too, but caught them when they toured through san francisco afterwards. the drummer was fantastic. i have all their albums in one form or another except shapes. i also heard this new song live and was thoroughly impressed. 
too bad alarm clock isnt that good live.
spirit of the radio - rush
agreed.  i was trying to convey that their sound in the context of the late 90's scene had much more impact on people than it maybe would if you were to discover them now -- not that they are the greatest band in the history of western music.  
and to further illustrate why hip-hop isn't so simple to pin down, sound-wise: it was culled from disco and funk records, where dj's would play the breaks, hence "break dancing". mcing came after the dj, and sampling became a natural and obvious extension of the live djing style.

edit: i just want to emphasize xiga's point. hip-hop is a culture, not a musical style.
best show i will probably ever see, unless i finally get to see lightning bolt.
he gave me a hug at the end of the show too.
the later instrumental part reminds me of vintage pink floyd.  i like it a lot.
to say that the beats were stolen is to miss the whole story of hip-hop culture. originally, the music of the original artists was played by dj's, and "train spotters" would seek out the records of the musicians that the dj was playing. so full props were given to the original artists.  eventually studio recordings of mcs sampled those records to capture the essence of the street dj. it was an organic growth, coming from a high place of respect for the original beats.
the amazingness just continues and continues for 11 minutes..  
zzzzz
i just don't know if that's even a genre of music?  plus "mature pop" sounds like something you'd use to describe robbie williams or sade, neither of which zero 7 sounds remotely like.
bingo
kmfdm [sucks!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efoqt2snyfs)
amazing how much he just seems to radiate energy.
sure, check out some tracks from everything but the girl.  maybe start with the song [mirrorball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh-bz_ahdsy), maybe also [no difference](http://www.last.fm/music/everything+but+the+girl/_/no+difference?autostart), and top it off with [single](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueyqiyibrlq).  that version of single is a remix but it's not bad.
alright, so i had a major headphone crush on zero 7 for a while, but have since moved on. if you really dig downtempo electronic music, i recommend everything on the [esl label](http://www.eslmusic.com/). their [*esl remixed*](http://www.amazon.com/esl-remixed/dp/b000s9chhw) disc is as fine an introduction as any.

however, as others have noted, it does electronic music a disservice to ignore other incredibly intelligent artists out there. [aphex twin](http://bleep.com/index.php?page=artist_details&amp;artistid=76) and [boards of canada](http://bleep.com/index.php?page=artist_details&amp;artistid=78) are both perennial favorites as are [unkle](http://bleep.com/index.php?page=artist_details&amp;artistid=3151) (*never, never land* is almost worship-worthy) and plastikman (nee richie hawtin -- i can't recommend *consumed* highly enough).
seriously one of my all-time favorite bands.  their first album is one of the few i listen to all the songs on and never tire of.  their remixes of various bands are incredible too.
anytime i hear kmfdm i think mortal kombat. that is not necessarily a good thing.

well-played. upvoted.
for trip hop that's a bit more "out there" check out four tet, (chris) clark [particularly his album called body riddle], and tobacco
this would probably qualify as "adult contemporary," even though that name is fraught with (unjustly) bad connotations.

people are whinging about them not being as good of an electronic group as some others. fine, but that doesn't sound like their focus to me--electronics and layering in the music is a tool for them.

i've been listening to various bands similar to this for decades. they're very good.

[zero 7 - destiny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inn1c6imjkg) &lt;&lt; so love this

zero 7 - when it falls (the song, off the album of the same name). for some reason i can't find a youtube or other free way to play this, but it is also awesome.

[thievery corporation - heaven's gonna burn your eyes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq0m6mm1i8y) frickin' sweet. this one is very zero 7-ish with the female vocals, the rest below diverge a bit.

[thievery corporation - tomorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkm4ydrav00) (i love the song uptempo switchups at 1:30 and 2:17! gives me spine chills)

[thievery corporation - lebanese blonde](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04bg9ic9n6w) (as featured in a number of movies like garden state and whatnot) i actually dated a lebanese blonde, so this song is always tied to her ;)

[thievery - black uhuru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt6vekcvrqg) nice dubstyle. love the drop at 2:14
i feel like a voyeur listening to this song.  it is so personal it feels exploitative.  i love this song, but it is really hard to listen to. 
i guess i should amend that i made no judgment call when i said that they were "stolen" -- i in fact appreciate the resourcefulness and ingenuity used. "good artists borrow, great artists steal."
i'm not going to downvote you because it's your opinion - but i love every song on that disc. 
i upmodded you, but you shouldn't have linked to the song so we could see how many idiots wuold have downmodded you.

[lg chocolate ringtone 12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjroqg5un2w#t=1m01s).
i'm pretty sure that translates to "no one does more for you". but i'll defer to you if you're from germany.

edit: my version would be "keiner macht für dich mehr", which fits the lyrics and is supposedly the official version. but that's the cool thing about german lyrics; you can't differentiate between uppercase and lowercase when you're hearing it, and who can tell the difference between keine and keiner over that ultra-heavy beat? "no power for you anymore" could fit any one of their songs just as easily.

whatever. at least we can agree on keep madonna from doing music, right?
pharoahe monch - simon says

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkugzfllz8i
no majority for the pitied.
i'm not from germany, but i get it.

macht, capitalized is a noun, so it means power. the verb machen would mean to make. so literally, it translates as "no power for you more"
well this is interesting.

"keiner macht für dich mehr" does translate to "no one does more for you," but a minor spelling change (removing the r at the end of keine which changes the meaning from "nobody" to "none") and a capitalization change of macht (the noun "power": see wehrmacht) versus "macht" (to do) changes the meaning of the whole goddamn sentence. lol

this is actually all described on the [kmfdm wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kmfdm) in the etymology section (i just discovered this).

i speak german fluently but am actually firstborn american. my parents and all my cousins are from the vaterland, though.
technically, the band says they actually put the band name ("kein mehrheit für die mitleid") together after cutting out words from a german newspaper and shuffling around the words: thus, nonsensical and grammatically incorrect.

konietzko supposedly put the version "kein mitleid für die mehrheit," the "correct" version, in megalomaniac as a kind of joke response to the people who were always informing them their name was wrong.

nice. yeah, our high school german teacher would sometimes let us translate kmfdm lyrics. i think we got that line translated before she cut the lesson short in a fit of nervous giggles when we asked her to translate "leid und elend" off of symbols. 

i think it was this part that sent her over the edge: "deiner süßen wunde süßer saft macht mich sehr betrunken ohne schnaps." 

can't imagine why...

she also giggled the time i unknowingly said "ich bin warm" ("i am gay" for you onlookers) instead of "mir ist warm" ("i am warm"). i have a feeling that happens in every german 1 class at least a dozen times.
ah, but their earlier stuff is much better.
wake pig is indeed awesome.  especially the follow-up solo, bramfatura.

i got to meet these guys a couple of times, once when i saw them open for porcupine tree in new york and again when they came through dallas.  awesome, awesome people.  i'm hoping they'll tour with coheed soon.

ugh, why do people keep recommending air? i love zero 7 and all that downtempo stuff, but could never get into air...
i would recommend morcheeba (more hip hoppy), thievery corporation (dubby), and maybe even emiliana torrini (poppy).
he should really turn on the lights rather than resort to light enhancing lenses.
you've got to warm up to it. i didn't think boc was a big deal at all when i first listened to it, but at some point it "clicked" with me, and years afterwards it's still one of my favorites. i have everything i can find by them.

i wouldn't really compare them to zero 7 though... they're both chillout music, but their sound and direction is completely different.
didn't help.
that's sia?! i should have known this! never ever occurred to me though. sia is not bad.
never knew he had a video out for this song, thanks.
his new stuff is pretty awesome (totems flare)
very awesome, thanks for posting this!  mindvirus, you rock!
mm &lt;3 air.   you should also check out groove salad at somafm.com if you're into this sort of music it's so so so good.
whatever happens to be on the radio. usually commercials :(
we've had this discussion in another thread, i know we both agreed that it's difficult to even get people to take your music for free sometimes.

that being said, my advice is give your music away for free. all of it. and sell t-shirts for cost. you aren't going to make money anyway, except by filling a bar, so you better start getting your music and shirts (free advertising) out there. there are tons of bands i like whose albums i don't have; it's fucked up, but it's because i couldn't download their album for free, and i'm broke. if i had their album, it would be in rotation and i'd end up turning other people on to the album, band, etc.

&gt;play lots of shows

i'm hearing this a lot. it's *barely* true. i'm sure you know this already, since you've been gigging. there are only two situations in which a show is actually going to help noticeably: (1) the bar has no cover &amp;/or a built-in crowd--college towns are a good example of where shows are actually a great idea--or (2) you open for someone hugely popular and you get lucky enough that their fans are there for your set for some reason (and drunk already). this just isn't going to happen, unless you're really lucky, but go ahead and network. it could happen. all this being said, it helps a lot if you set up a relationship with the other bands you do end up playing with, so that they convince their fans to stick around or come early or whatever. half the time, the other band isn't even watching your set. right? right. it's amazing how much sincere camaraderie can change a person's listening experience. make the other band your friends in as genuine a way as possible.

maybe i'm no expert on live shows, but that's what i think i learned in the time we were hitting chicago over the head with our music. we played over forty local shows in about a year and a half. protip: if you're not a coffeehouse dude or a cover band, that's *way* too many local shows.

lastly, build up your bullshit music resume. we got a few quotes about us from local music celebrities, and it started helping us to get slightly bigger gigs, which helped get our friends to actually come out (even your buddies don't want to go to the bars you're playing at now, am i right?). you also have to be thinking marketing, as fucking insincere as it seems, because there's only so far you can get with new listeners without having some kind of image. especially if you're trying to reach them through the internet.

but i almost certainly don't know what the fuck i'm talking about. again, good luck!

my favorite *of montreal* song, and quickly becoming one of my favorite songs ever.

there's a neat acoustic version on youtube, as well.

the one lyric that is one of my favorite:

"i find myself searching for old selves /
while speeding forward through the plateglass of maturing cells"

the best example that "new" om can be as good as old om.
really why would you down vote this? if you don't like it, you could still up vote it for the sake of making this talented artist better known.

this week's tape brought to you by cramps, confusions, and other side effects from spinning one's wheels.

enjoy!
generally you can say that all filters degrade light, but if the light receptors are going to burn out then it's better to dim down.

light enhancing lenses (as the op called them) is not really enhancing light but colour.
it's extracting (by blocking) some frequencies of light passing through it.  this is the opposite of color enhancement.
if you had shown me a semi-attractive woman wearing a tight sweater in 9th grade i would have creamed my shorts.
all colour enhancement done by passive means is, as you say, done by blocking unwanted frequencies of light. 

the result is that one colour seems enhanced. there's a reason it's called colour enhancement, not colour blocking, easier to identify the spectrum you want to end up seeing than listing all the parts you don't care about. unless it's a uv filter or something similar.


he doesn't say anything you obviously can't hear for yourself!
any time i hear obviously double-tracked or chorus-effected vocals now, it sounds like the '90s to me.

* 80s = gated snares
* 90s = doubled vocals
* 00s = digital: no noise, lots of compression, precise dynamic changes

i think jodv meant when he himself was in 9th grade.
even if he didn't, so what... if you were attracted at 15 there's no reason you wouldn't also be attracted at 30. if there's grass on the playing field, there's nothing weird about it biologically. just don't break any laws, and afaik, there is no law against creaming your shorts. so long as you keep your shorts on. 
yeah.  that *is* what i meant.

edit: i think my use of the word "woman" implies that the female involved is not a student.

hey, i practiced this weekend using the technique you mentioned and it really seemed to help - just wanted to say thanks!  :-)
some singing requires talent.  for everything else, there is autotune. 
the karma whore theme?
wise choice. those same people would mock those wearing a kmfdm tee at a kmfdm concert when the band is wearing their tees as well!

what great modern bands is he referring too?

most of the great modern bands i know of haven't risen that far, in fact most of them still work day jobs.

he did say....

&gt;and ultimately, don't think what i have to say about the subject is all that important.

**the thing is people asked.**

i think he is a good singer (in the unique sense) and does and excellent bass job, well within the context of the band.

the kiss make-up launched them all, but they all have sustained without it.
i'm right there with you. listened to the album when it release and couldn't get into it. revisited it a couple weeks ago and can't get enough.

hissing fauna is probably their best album. but i still love skeletal lamping.

listen from cherry peel up to skeletal lamping. it was a smooth transition in sound, and then bam! skeletal lamping.
and the minute they are signed, ergo turn "mainstream", you declare them sell-outs and finally come to the conclusion that they weren't that great after all?

please answer the following questions:

[ ] i am a hipster

[ ] hipsters are so 90s

[ ] stfu, i just love local bands

who gives a crap? how about another garbage record?
lj, avalanches, and kinobe are some of my favourites. really excellent stuff. checking out mono and massive attack.
he'll be back, he just needs some time.
i was in romeo high school at the same time. i remember that hair bouncing down the hallways between classes.
i'm a big fan of albini's studio work and his music.  he's really all about capturing the essence of the band.  it's more a documentary experience with him.

they both have their strengths, i just tend to prefer albini's approach much more.
got issues?
a lot of the bands i know that have a fair amount of success either in the us or even in europe still come home to a job after going on tour. 

i prefer the sound more local or regional bands have, but i could care less about the hipster pretense. i don't care about what's in fashion and i can appreciate popular music and have nothing against bands that go that route.

however, i find there are a lot more "great modern bands" outside of the mainstream than there are who have "risen" to mainstream success.  

it's just may taste, but if i had to pick an answer i would have to go with stfu, i just love local bands and it's been what i have listened to for the past 15 or so years. 

there are always new and exciting bands popping up, but  a lot of them don't get the attention they deserve.

edit: typo
for real.  i know i sound like a broken record when i say this, but at least 90% of the comments on youtube are completely vitriolic.
ya this was an amazing show. other episodes worth checking out: jimi hendrix - electric ladyland, u2 - joshua tree, bob marley and the wailers...actually they're all good!
or, he needs to run out of money, whichever comes first.
that's great to hear, and you're welcome! you can try intervals and chords next, all using the wrist technique. it's also not just about softness of touch, but also about speed of transition. accomplished pianists can play from chord to chord very smoothly and softly without the use of pedal.  
great album! now i like listening to it while i'm yelling at kids to get off my lawn.
vocoder &gt; autotune
yes.
why does great have to equal fiscally independent?  you're basing success on a broken business model in a time when piracy is prevalent.

&gt;"as much music as musicians can hear, that will only make music richer as an artform," pecknold told bbc news.

&gt;"i think we're seeing that now with tons of new bands that are amazing, and are doing way better music now than was being made pre-napster." 

clearly he was talking about music as an art form and that which was pirated influenced.
http://www.metacritic.com/music/bests/

you're trying to tell me there's not one record on there by a new band (not a rerelease or a new record by a longtime musician) that you enjoy?


i feel like albini's approach is more organic and raw where vig has compressed the crap out of all of his recordings.  vig's production sounds overproduced to me, and the narrow frequency range always killed nevermind for me.  in utero was a far superior recording to nevermind.  
"i mean, how much money does one person need? i think it's disgusting when people complain about that, personally." 

from what i gather, artists make most of their revenue off of live shows and selling merch there.

i don't really care if any musician cannot live off of their music and i don't feel bad about stealing music.
most obvious downloading success story of the past few years is vampire weekend.  their self-recorded debut album was spread over the internets and turned into a huge hit when it was released, in its original form, on a major label.

the arctic monkeys were another good example.  their first album was recorded entirely in their garage without any studio engineers or record company support and became a massive success.  
wtf was with trey?
no offense, your first comment just sounded like the typical hipster phrase - that's why i put in the third option.

i am fully with you, but do have to say, that it depends very much on where you live. if you live in a major us city, you will not have any problems finding lots of great local bands in hundreds of different scenes/genres. living in a more rural area or in some small city in a small european country things get a lot tougher.

i appreciate the world of music blogs (for eg.) for a variety of music genres and bands unknown to me. most of them are way off mainstream, but depending on how you define it, lots of mainstream, too.

&gt; there are always new and exciting bands popping up, but a lot of them don't get the attention they deserve.

and you don't think the internet is a wonderful thing for raising that attention?
huh?
who?
attak, wwiii and hau ruck didn't do it for me.  i think blitz and tohuvabohu have a few goods songs.  i especially like sascha's new non-distorted vocal stylings.  i still can't stand lucia, though.  
  
there's also a few good tracks on skold vs. kmfdm
fleet foxes, arctic monkeys, lupe fiasco, vampire weekend, coco rosie are some of my favorites
new age, ambient, spirit, nature &amp; world music.
i actually live in a small southern town and of course the internet has helped bands get some exposure. but when i was a teenager i still could find out about bands through mailorder with labels and zines.

and i don't doubt that illegal downloading has helped out a lot of bands, but since i listen to mostly local bands i would rather support them by buying their records.
i have a live bootleg of them doing covers early in their career, great versions of smoke detector and microwave tunes.

not a new discovery for me, but it's been a favorite melodic punk track for a while. blast to see live.
attention. whore.

he continually manages to keep himself in the news, if only just a little bit.
nickelback's new album is pretty good, thinking of picking up the new fall out boy album later
nope just a fan.
well that is the hypocrisy of the american people, not gene who is spouting some career advice, since he's been in the business.
&gt;i stand by my assessment that's it's a mistake (at this early stage of his career) to out himself. believe me, it's a big mistake. i hope for lambert's sake, i'm completely wrong. but i believe this may impede his career. not everyone lives in la, and not everyone wants to deal with private issues. main talking points seem to be lambert's sexual preferences, instead of his talent. and that's a career killer.
about as subtle a trolling as chad kroger's lyrics.
you've never heard of [vampire weekend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vampire_weekend) or the [arctic monkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_arctic_monkeys_awards)?  
ok, tell that to the beatles and elvis.
tell that to disney who is more than cartoons.
tell that to any star in this day and age who are crossing over into other areas of business. kiss just giving the fans what they ask for. if it didn't sell, it wouldn't be on the market. people come knocking on their door to put the logo and make-up on their products. more are turned down than put out into the public.
&gt;but pecknold said he did not object to file-sharing. "i've downloaded hundreds and hundreds of records - why would i care if somebody downloads ours? that's such a petty thing to care about. 

*goes to mininova*
definitely agreed there.

vig is able to make radio friendly easy consumption records.  i personally like recordings to have more dynamics. i'm looking at grabbing the tape op books, they have some albini interviews in them that i haven't read before.  i don't know if you read tape op but it's a free recording magazine, with some really great interviews of creative recording engineers and artists.

how is an artist making a living a broken business model? 

and of course greatness doesn't have to equal fiscally independent. i just stated the fact that a lot of great modern bands are not fiscally independent.

there are a lot of good bands out now, but i wouldn't say that what new bands are doing is "way better" than what was being made pre-napster.

he just seems to have a rather high opinion of his musical tastes.

when are the fleet foxes finally going to come out with a new album so i can illegally download it?
a very free dutch interpretation.
great link, thanks.  bookmarked it.
am i the only one that loves btjunkie more? [here](http://btjunkie.org/torrent/fleet-foxes-collection/4154aaf6ab8daeb28d863390a1f33080658947d238fc) is a collection it seem like its legit too.

you're kind of a dick, man
i'm not really into that track. maybe i'm just not in the mood. so, take my suggestions with a grain of salt...

- lettuce
- topaz
- soul live
- karl denson
- greyboy allstars

reminds me a little of si-se, though they're not really funk-jazz.
didn't know about that.  thank you.  i don't use bt that much.
&gt;how is an artist making a living a broken business model?

to imply that the current business model empowers artists to make a living is naive at best, and totally disingenuous otherwise. 

very, very, very rarely do artists make enough money after the record label has taken it's 98% to justify the time spent. very rarely can bands do it full time.

the overhead in the riaa is almost as ridiculous as the overhead in the american healthcare system.


i'm kind of dick? did you read the comments the guy from fleet foxes made in the article?

he just said that him and his friends' bands are "way better" than the classics that he influenced him musically. i think that's kind of dick move. 

yeah i love all of the classics, but the stuff musicians are doing now is "way better" like have you heard my new fleet foxes record?


too bad i illegally downloaded the fleet foxes album so i knew they were just a bad rip off of better bands.
mogwai, black eyes, deerhoof, the microphones, radiohead
what about the feedback he talks about that was changed for the final version of the song and he wishes it hadn't been? 
i didn't mean to imply that the previous model was working out well for most musicians  either, but i wouldn't say because there are few success stories with the new model that illegal downloading is going to be a great replacement. 

the music business will be just like it was before the internet a few bands will make it, but most will get lost in the shuffle.
i would second just about every other suggestion made but would add:

- mandalay

- chicane

- telepopmusik

- dusted (rollo armstrong of faithless side project)

- delta 76

- psychosonic

some that are a little bit of a stretch:

- esthero (first record, not later releases)

- sneaker pimps (first record, not later releases)

- faithless

- hooverphonic

- massive attack

"that's how i discovered **pentangle** when i was a teenager."
i disagree. most modern bands, except for mega stars, make their money on tour, not on records.

it stands to reason, then, that most modern bands can make their money on tour, and give their albums away for nothing.

common arguments:

* "but it costs money to make music." 

partially true. an indie band can put together great music and good recordings with cheap equipment. 

anyone who tells you you need to sign with a label and get $200,000 to make your next record just wants to rape you.

* creation of the physical product, promotion, etc costs money

also true, but again, the current system is setup to abuse artists, not disseminate their music and promote them.

now, whether or not music should be free is a moot point.

music **is** free and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

the only winning move is to embrace the internet, the digital revolution, the piracy.

i would prefer if they embraced it with free music, but could you imagine what it would do to piracy if music cost nine cents instead of 99c? a whole album for no more than two dollars?

i'm on record right now as saying it: i'd never pirate another song. 

and without the recording industry to eat up the money on lawyers and executives driving beamers, 10c would be more than enough. 
mike jones
i wish trent reznor would fuck right off.
&gt;he just seems to have a rather high opinion of his musical tastes.

who doesn't?  everyone has a little sanctimony and pretentiousness in their own music tastes and an artist even more so.

&gt;and of course greatness doesn't have to equal fiscally independent. i just stated the fact that a lot of great modern bands are not fiscally independent.

the way you stated it implied that to be great one must be fiscally independent. 

&gt;how is an artist making a living a broken business model?

really?  alright.  the business model is broken in that artists only see minuscule gains from cd sales, the bulk of which go to the recording companies. artists have to tour to make any real money.  

instead of embracing new technology and finding the profit in it, those with the power decided to criminalize those who would rather download music than hop on over to the local walmart or best buy and pick up their new jordan sparks' cd. on top of that they took an established, (formerly) popular medium to get your product to the consumer and tried to keep the content limited to that physical disc, which did not work. then they accepted that the downloadable song was here to stay and then tried to lock that down, which didn't work either.  they would rather fight to protect the archaic medium of plastic cds and plastic cases and punish the consumer. 

 the current climate is far better than it was, but it was so late to market that people already had their source for the music. sure there are people on both sides of the fence, who pirate and purchase, but the hundreds of millions that were lost because someone decided that p2p and filesharing were just a fad.

if you are not a fleet foxes fan become one.
i don't understand what you have against the man, i'd kill for a bathroom i can play baseball in
vampire weekend is the jimmy buffet of the new century.
i agree most bands don't make a huge cut from a record, but if their records sell they're more likely to be able to put out another record or have the label support them for a tour.  

if people wanna download music for free that's fine, in fact most of my music is available for free to download. 

i still prefer the old-fashioned way of buying an actual physical record, i collect vinyl so that's part of the joy too, but if i dig a band i try to buy a record even if it's just a 7" or something on emusic where i can get it for cheap.

i don't mean to be a weenie and those are all great bands, but with the exception of black eyes, all of those artists had international success long before anyone was downloading music.

he is saying that new bands are better because they are inspired by the classics. they have much greater access and have listened to much more music than bands did in the '90s, pre-napster. 
i think you'll find arctic monkeys took off because the major record label behind them hired a pr firm to get the mainstream media to write about how the band because famous via the internet, as well as hiring a plugger to get songs on the radio and on tv and also supplying the budget for an advertising campaign.
it didn't. sorry.
supposedly sometime this year. that's what i heard a couple months ago, but i don't know if they'll follow through on getting it out this year. 
yeah i understand what he was trying to say, but i think that's a very questionable statement in terms of it improving music and the way people play it.


that may be right, but weren't the arctic monkeys voted best british band of all time in some poll that took place *before* their first album came out?

if so, i'd attribute that to leaked music downloaded illegally.
this may be my favorite track of theirs :)
that collection is missing a couple songs.

alternate version of mykonos is def. a track not to miss. outstanding.

oh i've heard this a lot!  but i can't place where.  i like it.  i think it may be used a lot in commercials or movie trailers?
edit: figured it out - i heard it in little miss sunshine :)
"i think we're seeing that now with tons of new bands that are amazing, and are doing way better music now than was being made pre-napster."

i feel dumber for having read that.
i was replying specifically the listing of mogwai, deerhoof, the microphones and radiohead.

the arctic monkeys are definitely a good example of downloading success, however after acknowledging their monetary/cultural success, the music fan in me needs to disclose that i think their music is nothing special at best.
cool thanks brother!
mykonos is my favorite song right now. i can't listen to it enough it seems like.

the alternate version is good, but the original is where it's at.
well, i don't know if great modern bands arose because of piracy, but i sure know it opened my eyes quicker. i got my own computer for christmas in '99 and my uncle, who was staying on my bottom bunk, showed me a program called napster. at the time, i was thinking "wtf is this, i don't get it" and today, i can attribute to him the expansion of my taste in music.

however, i feel broadband plays more of a role than illegal downloading. piracy is just the inevitable offspring of so much free bandwidth and back then, i was lucky in my area to have cable. it's kind of a chicken or the egg sort of situation...
it's subjective. but it can't be a bad thing for anyone to listen to a broader, deeper catalog of music. something that wasn't as easy to do when money and physical access were limiting factors. 
yeah. i the alternate version is good, but the original is so much better that i can't stand the alternate version because it seems like a bad cover. 
the rise and fall of grunge
the best example is probably clap your hands say yeah, considering their self-financed first album had sold more than 200k copies at the time they released their second.
woah, i'm glad i was there. despite reznor being a "wanker" in the press, it was a good show.
qotsa - the fun machine took a shit and died
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xlxi8t7ry

it's one of those tracks you tend to skip over, but if you take the time to listen to it you get lost in all that's going on.  it seems like a perfect song for a title sequence or short film the way it builds up.
"how much money does one person need" - that comment ruins the whole article.  it's not a matter of how much, it's the fact that most artists and musicians deserve (and want) to be paid for creating what they're creating
surely, you're not comparing kiss to the beatles or elvis?

kiss' music was always substandard. once they started whoring themselves out, it became obvious why. and once they lost ace, they never had a decent song after that anyway.
lately, fake empire by the national.
would i have ended up at those gogol bordello shows or bought that gogol bordello shirt if i had never even heard their music?

i know it's a tired and oft-repeated statement but bands can still make plenty of money in ways that can never really be affected (except positively) by piracy.
&gt;i still prefer the old-fashioned way of buying an actual physical record

me too, and how wonderful would it be if the artist saw more than a few cents on a $15 record?


yup.  well, sort of

&gt; at the heart of this music revolution, declared the money programme, was a social networking website called myspace. "with the boost from myspace, the arctic monkeys proved yet again that successful bands can do without big record companies. they released their debut single and album on small independent label domino. both went straight to no 1."

&gt; in fact the monkeys' first release was a limited seven-inch vinyl single on bang bang records. __domino, far from being the fledgling start-up operation, had already brought franz ferdinand to international prominence. another thing: the monkeys' have never had an official myspace site__.

&gt; yes, there is an arctic monkeys page on myspace, set up last august. but as the disclaimer makes clear, it is a fan site, unconnected to the band or management.

&gt; according to johnny bradshaw, the monkeys' product manager at domino, the band didn't even know what myspace was until three months ago.

so, yes, the whole "famous thanks to myspace!!1!!! not the old school record company funded pr machinations" meme turns out to be horseshit.  on the other hand:

&gt; "there's so much confusion about how the arctic monkeys got their music out there in the first place," he says. "they handed out 50 cd-rs at the early shows to a small group of fans. as __the fans started file sharing them, that's how it spread over the internet__. it was word of mouth."

i was lucky to grow up in south america were the record stores sell you the imports and if you cannot afford it they will burn you a copy for a fraction of the price, complete with the cover and everything...
they will also make you mixtapes and mixcds of your favorite songs for a little extra.
that's how i got into record collecting and now i own over 2000 records and some 500 cd's,
i still prefer to buy the records over cds.
that was before knowing about mp3's.
but that allowed me to buy just the records i like, otherwise i will have the same amount of records but wouldn't like any, i think that is the main reason people loose interest in buying music, it gets too expensive if you buy all the music you don't really like because you didn't hear it well or couldn't hear it at all before buying, sometimes going to the records store they will let you preview let's say 5 records and then you have to buy one no matter what or they kick you out.

ah i remember the good old days of tony hawk's pro skater 3.
the real 60s smile is *still* illegal to download. i highly recommend it.
a good record store is better than any torrent site. they'll let you listen before you buy, have good recommendations, and can order anything you want. and they'll have things that aren't online.

yeah, i'm just not that big of a fan of the arctic monkeys, fleet foxes, frightened rabbits, panda bears, animal collectives or even the naked mole rats. 

i mean there's nothing wrong with any of those bands, it's just not my bag. i don't think that they're any more "amazing" or "way better" for having free access to illegal music.

edit: after doing some research i noticed that [the naked mole rats](http://www.guitar9.com/guitarmusic9/fortunecookiemonster.html) actually changed their name to little dead riding hood, possibly to avoid confusion with all the other band names taken from the animal kingdom. i think it was a good move, whatever the reason.

when i was a kid i lived down the street from a guy who made pirated 8-track mix tapes and if i wanted to hear new stuff i had to go dumpster diving for his overstock. (actually true)

[grace jones - williams blood (aeroplane remix)](http://blousesydney.blogspot.com/2009/06/who-is-she.html)
almost put this song. it's amazing!
[mos def, talib kweli &amp; common - respiration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0zakbh1eeu)
you don't know massive attack? i thought we passed some laws regarding that.

maybe start with mezzanine. a significant portion of babies were conceived to that album. 
or tarantula (my personal fav of pendulum)
i'd probably have to agree with dsotm, wywh, and animals being more enjoyable albums. but man, the wall, as a double concept album, is amazing in its own way. you really can't listen to just one song, even though there are some gems, it's the collevtive sum of its parts that hit me the other day for the first time. 

a child, whose first memories are the bombing of london, having an overbearing mother, teachers that ridiculed him for writing poetry and being different, goes skating on the thin ice of modern life. he achieves success but his wife leaves him when he's on tour, and his awkwardness around women turns into violence, all of these are just bricks in the wall he constructs to shield himself from the outside world. someone stands outside saying hey you, but he can't answer, turns his persona to one of a fascist dictator and then just decides to wait for the worms to enter his brain. really cool shit imho.  

i think it's because i can relate to the idea of self-imposed isolation now, whereas i couldn't as a teenager, for that reason the wall now makes sense to me.

but i will say that to me david gilmour's sound, his vocals and guitar playing, are really what made pink floyd what it was.  
everything with autotune used as an effect will sound hopelessly dated in a few years once if falls out of fashion.

what is this "things that aren't online" that you speak of?
"animals" is a concept too though. the difference being that the songs all stand up on their own.

i love the concept of "the wall". but could it have been better had gilmour, wright and mason mitigated some of water's insanity?

we'll never know.
i like other sites a little better as far as amount of content but mininova just has a cleaner feel to it. i'm not sure if anyone will even understand that but some of the torrent sites just seem so hastily thrown together. 
i wouldn't listen to half the music that i do now if it wasn't for downloading albums. i buy as much as i can as far as indie and underground bands are considered but if its mainstream i don't feel bad "stealing" the album.
i'm all for supporting the local record shop but being local means that albums cost more than they would normally. i try to buy one or two albums a month from the one by me just because i grew up in the local music scene. 


edit: everything is online btw.
from the day we arrive on the planet

i think he meant to say how much money does one person need to purchase all the music that one enjoys. 
who gives a fuck about an oxford comma?!
have you listened to the new animal collective album? i admit, i'm not much of an ac fan myself, but merriweather post pavilion is quite different than their previous stuff.
- anthony hopkins ?

i'll be going to san miguel for the chamber music festival in august. hope to see you there!
glad you like it! keep checking out my site - it should be up on itunes and amazon mp3 at some point soon. the distributor reckons up to six weeks. boo!
well i think my post summed that one up, but no, i haven't heard of them. i'll check them out with my zune pass or wherever tonight though.
i like the atmospherics in your music - it's a really good sound, pretty cinematic.

i'll definitely be listening to this some more!

what do you guys think of siamese dream? definitely one of my favorite albums.
my friend loves that site but i haven't looked at it in depth.  i'll take a gander.  steve albini is a really a brilliant producer, though i have to admit not loving the one big black album i picked up.  
elvis costello - welcome to the working week
maybe not mininova.....
i really, really like this. are they a new band? i lived in seogwipo about three years ago and tried really hard to find good music. cherry filter, crying nut, etc. never heard of these dudes.

good stuff, though. thanks!

edit: [but not as good as this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzfvfyr5f1e)
they're both good but in different ways.  the arctic monkeys are a great hard rock band.  very innovative, both lyrically and melodically.  their music is deceptively simple but charged up and smart.  vampire weekend's music is at least tentatively based on african soweto music, which informs some of the melodies and instruments the band uses.  but for the most part, their album sounds like something you recorded in your dorm room while drunk and/or stoned and then presented to your friends in the dining hall.  
-elton john
that means file-sharing is also responsible for lady gaga.  i shall never torrent again.
just omg!

mad ambience, this will take some listening - it sounds huge!!!

it's definitely not something my mum would hum along to though... very cool.
you can do all that online, for free.
its how i discovered fleetfoxes. i probably wouldn't have given them a chance without it.
youre the only one that doesnt use what.cd/demonoid/isohunt in that order.
if you guys remember first aid kit, i decided to download the fleet foxes album because reddit had a video of the two girls that make of first aid kit singing a beautiful cover of one of fleet foxes' songs. i also got the first aid kit ep, and would recommend that to anyone that enjoys fleet foxes.
except that its free online. reddit/pandora/thesixtyone/what.cd are my recommendations. and i can find anything i want usually.



my next cd purchase is going to be lady danville though. theyre a badass acoustic group, and i feel they need my support.


www.myspace.com/ladydanville. fans of fleet foxes will probably enjoy them :)
yeah, that was good too. 
what kind of system do you have?
i wish there was a reddit that was devoted to inarguably transcendent, perfect things like this.
and i credit my illegal download of the foxes' first album as the reason i purchased a physical copy of their second.
no i think he meant to say that it's absurd for artists already sitting on millions of dollars to complain about the little bit they aren't getting due to file sharing.
i prefer less mainstream bands.
the only thing left was some jonas brothers memorabilia and guitar hero action figures...
how many hipsters does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
 it's a really obscure number... you've probably never heard of it.

i agree about arctic monkeys, not a big fan here.  anyway, i wasn't listing those as bands that became known because of their success among pirates, just as bands that are good and modern.
hey, this is pretty nice. catchy too.

there was a great article in eq about billy corgan.  it outlined the pumpkins recording sessions.  i think vig was a great match up for that album.  corgan wanted a wall of sound and some really driving guitars.  him producing/engineering that album was a pretty good fit.

each producer/engineer has their own bonuses.  i just personally like albini's approach most of the time.

yeah i like some dissonant annoying music.  heh, big black isn't for everyone, rapeman isn't either.  here are a couple songs i dig.

big black - jordan, minnesota (the song is about the rumors that there was a satanic cult in the small town that was abusing children)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_gfun_llqs

big black - kerosene (about growing up in a small town with nothing going on, so playing with fire or having sex were a few of the limited options)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlr5exyoqce

rapeman - hated chinee + budd (hated chinee is about discrimination against chinese people, budd is about budd dwyer, the politician who killed himself on live tv)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=megdpvy46q0

with those posted, the lyrics can be dark for both.  sonically i like what he does.  it's a mix of dissonance and aggression.  and he clearly likes to talk about topics that make people squeamish.
was there just one show in la or did they do a tour? i thought they were from virginia?
fleet foxes put me to sleep. but to each their own.
i discovered cold war kids on the seat-back display on a delta jet last year. they're good, but it was depressing that delta is now cooler than me.

why would the opening riff to "turning japanese" be "chinese"?
couldn't agree with you more on both accounts.
i liked that album, actually.  that was one of his bands?
i love the way that line is delivered. 
i love that you mentioned beulah, but i discovered them at a listening station in a (now closed) lower east side record store.  so to me, they're from the pre-download era.
looks like the official [youtube user](http://www.youtube.com/user/officialnasa) has eight videos from this album.

you know what was great? mp3.com
all that was available at that time was 56k modems and not even napster was kicking around that i knew of. mp3.com was the first time i was allowed access to local bands from other areas of north america and sometimes the rest of the world. spending hours a night with a dad screaming at you "stop using up the phone line!" as your download *maybe* hit 5kb down, an hour later you would get 1 brand new song of a band you would otherwise have **no** access to. a lot of those great bands i found didn't become a "great modern band" like they describe it, but they will shaped my listening influence into what it is today and i still appreciate that.

okay, now do the thai opening to [one night in bangkok](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnqj31vpnoe)
because, sadly, many westerners can't be bothered to tell the difference.
because the song is not really about anything japanese, rather having your world turned completely around, as in 'the orient'.
or they really can't tell from only looking at them. can you tell the difference between a tutsi and a malagasy? perhaps you could tell the difference between a persian and an arabian. i don't think i can tell a scotsman from an irishman before he speaks, and even then, it is only because i know english.
i discovered them at the middle east when they weren't on a record label yet and bought all three of their eps (way better than their re-recorded label-released album), they were just touring the country - true story.... that one night in boston... that was a fucked up night. /music snobbery
they really are, had they not broken up i think the internet would have made them explode with popularity... i mean it did, but they broke up a little too soon. breaks my heart. at least miles has written a new record, hopefully his arm heals and he can finish it. they still had to have day jobs if i remember correctly.

that's despicable.  the guy basically psychologically manipulated and broke a 13 year old girl to win an argument.  it seems to be from 1990 (from the url, the fact that their discussing disintegration, and the fact that she couldn't just ask him to play "friday i'm in love" to defeat his whole argument), i'd love to know what she thinks listening back now.
&gt;surely, you're not comparing kiss to the beatles or elvis?


i was using it as an example, even paul stanley has said "there's the beatles and then there is everyone else". i'm not really a fan of either, but doesn't mean they aren't important (they are the blue print of rock and roll).
&gt;kiss' music was always substandard. once they started whoring themselves out, it became obvious why. and once they lost ace, they never had a decent song after that anyway.


you might *think* that, but the fact is fans like it. kiss couldn't survive on merchandise and gimmicks alone since. proof is when they took off the make-up, with-out ace, with-out peter. despite not being as big as they were in the 70's, they still release platinum album after platinum album. not to burn ace and/or peter, but their solo albums didn't sell nearly as much. i did like most of ace's stuff and would have to be in a mood to like peters.
the song is actually about jerking it, don't believe me read the lyrics.
this is what the internet was built for.
any idea why facebook would block this link as being offensive?
japanese and chinese are more distinct than the examples you gave.

it's the eyes. japanese have smoother eyelids and the eyes are more "slitty"

chinese eyes are more open and the lids aren't as smooth.

or it's the other way around

my band recently decided to add this song to our set, and my girlfriend is japanese. ah, the universe works in hilarious ways.
there's no real defining factor, although the eyes are often time characteristic. the easiest way to tell is just to know more chinese/japanese people at which point you begin to attribute certain subtle differences in facial dimensions and characteristics to their respective race.
very cool! has some nice sounds and one that sounds like a crying baby.
yeah, that is hard to listen to.

i used timidity


but there is significant overlap between the features of many japanese and koreans, and the chinese themselves run a pretty wide gamut of features depending upon what region within china the individual is from.
happy together by the turtles
well, that's cute and all, but some of the most interesting and educational links i've seen have been from my facebook friends. so why is this one different?
the best way is if you know the names. chinese names are generally a lot shorter names, like chang, zhang, or liang whereas japanese has longer names with more syllables. 

as an experiment- compare the lists of [japanese americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_japanese_americans) and [chinese americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_chinese_americans) on wikipedia.

comparing just the names in the category of art and design and art and architecture there's an obvious pattern. every chinese last name is monosyllabic. every japanese last name has at least three syllables. 

general physical characteristics might help, but it's all about the names. the only polysyllabic chinese last name i can think of is zedong, and hopefully everyone can think of some way to remember that one. 
i totally forgot what riff he was reffering to and the mortal kombat song was all i could think of.

super rad - the aquabats
it's a bunch of subtle differences in face composition. china contains a broader range of ethnic types than japan does though.

tutsi and malagasy, i can't honestly say. arabs and persians are rather different once you look beyond the fact that they're both "brown".

as for the scots and irish, ethnically they're almost the same people. scotland used to be an irish kingdom.
i heard them 10 years ago in a record store.  any help would be appreciated. 
well it is likely that the japanaese ultimately descend from a proto-korean people, themselves descended from a group of people who likely lived in what is now china. we're all just little twigs on the gigantic tree of life. the ones that are closer together look more alike than the ones further away, but really human beings in general are scarcely distinguishable from each other. 
can you tell the difference between a tongan and a samoan? can you tell the difference between a bolivian and a mexican? i can. it all depends on how familiar you are with the distinctive features of people.

it is racist to say "all black people look the same" or "all asians look the same", but if you spend your life only seeing white caucasians, then it is somewhat true. if you ask any chinese or japanese person, they can easily tell the difference. if you ask anyone who grew up surrounded by chinese and japanese, then they can easily tell the difference.

there was a study done where participants had to distinguish between photos of random black people. it turned out that those who follow the nba closely performed much better.
wow, that cartoon is incredibly racist... hahaha
i believe i read a study that says that people can tell differences in faces inside of their race better than outside of it. perhaps it is all just familiarity.

[you got yr. cherry bomb - spoon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4cgryw0q9u)

this song makes happy to be alive. it just does. 
ah, sorry, then. i only need the music. i moved there from pandora when firefox had a bad memory leak and never went back.

after a couple months, i realized that i wanted to have the music all of the time. i killed three xm radios and bought a g2. it is pure joy. 

the g2 loads your slacker station selections on from usb or wifi. it'll store more music than the battery can play ;-) i have 13 stations on mine. it also has 3mb of user storage where i keep some audiobooks.

i knwo this sounds like a commercial. i really, truly enjoy the musical freedom. they have a very large selection, and the benefit of my not having to bother with playlists or storing mp3s.

yes, in science, you are required to prove just about everything that you say objectively instead of relying on common knowledge, because common knowledge is frequently incorrect.
it's all a question of how far back the common ancestor was. in the case of the japanese and chinese, probably many thousands of years, ie, long enough for some noticeable differences to arise. in the case of the irish and scottish, we're talking 1300 years. 

&gt;the ones that are closer together look more alike than the ones further away, but really human beings in general are scarcely distinguishable from each other.

you could make the same statement about any objects which have any common properties. it all depends on your criteria for judgement.
now which portion of china are you thinking?  there are quite a few ethnicities within the chinese borders.
_easy tip:_

to play chinese music, hit the black keys on a piano in any order. that's a pentatonic (5-note) scale.

[here's a video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8sbsevdquk)

for japanese music, repeat f-a-b. f to b is a tritone.

&gt;can you tell the difference between a tongan and a samoan?

as a samoan, no =/ i should work on that because where i'm from, they don't get along. luckily, i look more spanish, so i don't really have to worry.
im just curious as to how long you stared at
"da-na-na-na na na nuh nuh naa" to make sure it was right.
&gt;the only polysyllabic chinese last name i can think of is zedong

mao zedong's "last name" is mao; in chinese, people put their family names before their given name.
i read the vocalization as the 'deliverance' riff.
veruca salt possibly? i recall a song of there's with plenty of screaming
pentatonic is shared with a lot of cultures:  scottish, native american, african american hymnals, many folk songs.  it's kinda odd how it's almost universal like that.
i have a tie i painted up with that scheme. 
to be fair, its not katy personally doing this, but rather her recording company.
the raping of the english language was enough for me to say no.
keep your eyes on the road prowlaman
i believe the band said it was about falling in love and, as arcadebumstead said, having your world turned upside down by it. i'm pretty sure they specifically said it was not about jerking it.
&gt;it's kinda odd how it's almost universal like that.

math is universal, and music is just auditory math.
poor form.
well if katy was a stand up woman she'd tell the label to take a fucking hike.  i mean.. don't they get that the internet, once it gets out... will just destroy them?
as if i needed more reasons to hate that cunt.

and to those saying that it wasn't katy perry herself suing the woman: she's not telling her label they're being dickwads either, is she?
as others have noted, this is the record company, not her personally.  but the most ridiculous thing about this is that katy perry's birth name was katy hudson.  so who should really have a right sue here???
katheryn elizabeth hudson (born october 25, 1984), better known by her stage name katy perry...

i think the fashion designer has at least a little more reason to be using the name.
and the autotune kicks its foot out at the last second to stop the door from slamming shut.

i actually had a conversation about it with a friend, and that was his suggestion. i originally wanted to go with more of a "dee-dee-dee-dee" 
i wonder if katie would sell her domain name
to be fair, if she wanted to not come off like a complete bitch, then she'd call off the recording company so they don't paint her as an enormous raging cunt sack.
what do you not understand?
it would have taken me at least 20 minutes to be certain.
and katy perry can't go back to katy hudson, or goldie hawn's daughter will sue her! tragic for the poor girl.
i'd recommend resubmitting this to a more frequented subreddit, that way we can get the internet justice ball rolling.
there's really nothing like free publicity.
i doubt the singer even knew this happened.  the lawyers probably represent some music company that katy perry signed a contract with.  she probably has no choice as the scum bags do this as a matter of course. 

saying *"lawyers sue local fashion designer..."* just doesn't attact as much attention. 
something similar happened here:

http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/articlenews/story/ctvnews/1121904221899_36/?hub=canada

the good guy (girl) won!
i came here to say just 1 word: cunt.

that being said i hate her too.  also i think her expiration is past.  this is probably just a publicity stunt to garner something for a useless career.
who?
enormous raging cunt sack

i hope the over capitalization does it for you too :d
thanks.  i always thought of it as something to sit down and listen to with your eyes closed, and not very good for casual listening.  i am glad you enjoyed it!
why would you submit an article from *mtv.com* about *katy perry* to /r/*music*?
but every twat has a twitter, and she could be speaking out against it.  this makes her complacent and cooperative.
[really?](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4564723/sun_city_girls_(1984_to_1997)
katheryn elizabeth hudson is a twat.
okay,who the fuck *is* kat**y** perry? i never heard of the bitch.
if katie perry's business is reaping rewards from its similarity in name to katy perry, then it is infringing upon the existing trademark (before anyone gets pissy about someone trademarking their own name, this is exactly what katie perry the fashion designer was trying to do when she got the cease and desist). just because that is your given name doesn't mean you can use that happy coincidence to piggy back off of someone else's success.

this is a particularly difficult area when dealing with existing businesses that are sued by other businesses that form *later* but which achieve much greater success (anyone remember etoys/etoy?). in this case it's unclear whether katie perry was intentionally trying to piggyback on katy perry's success (according to the article her business was formed before katy perry really hit it bigtime), but law is law.

before you downvote, please consider this as a debatable point of discussion rather than an excuse to feign outrage.
i sued a girl and i liked it?
i've heard "all white people look the same" from a few east asian or black acquaintances of mine. same idea there... just as a violin and viola sound the same unless you listen to enough music.
you never heard of her, and you're calling her a bitch?

that' so unfair to the cunt.
amusing of course that the record company legal division checks with its recording artists before launching legal proceedings.
like a lesser version of ray lamontagne...
you really think katy perry has any control over what her record label does with her name?  *the record label owns her*.  they can do whatever they want.  yeah, it's a really shitty thing for them to do, but they probably see it as protecting their investment.
[loudness treatment](http://turnmeup.org/): in case you don't know why all the new cd's you buy sound bad.
if she's that hard-up for cash, katy perry should just sing a jingle for a monster cable advertisement.
&gt;fisher adams kelly, who were acting on behalf of katy perry...

as such, katy perry is 100% responsible, and has the power to initiate, continue, or end these legal shenanigans.
katy perry can go suck a dick and choke to death on it, stupid slut.
just back from the festival. fnm were awesome!
&gt;if katie perry's business is reaping rewards from its similarity in name to katy perry, then it is infringing upon the existing trademark

as i understand the trademark issue, katy perry the singer only really has a case if she is in the same industry as katie perry the fashion designer.  katie perry, however, does not appear to be infringing on katy perry's business in any way, though.
she should counter-sue.
i just got a car with an aux input jack, and i'm looking for a reasonably priced player that will play mp3 and ogg files. any recommendations?

a bit surprised he doesn't refer to [tchaikovsky's version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lla1xofryj0), considering some of the songs he does note share very little similarity. tchaikovsky's dance in the nutcracker certainly isn't the same tune, but it does have the sort of staccato, high toned melody he notes in other songs, with some harmonizing. (note: i almost failed history of music 101, so i'm sorry if i'm getting terms wrong.)
they're doing it in her name, therefore, she is doing it. you can delegate authority, but you cannot delegate responsibility.
i was curious about this too, i think its debatable on who is right, although i think it would be very kind (and better publicity) of katy perry (and/or her lawyers) to be generous and drop the matter. and i do kind of give the designer the benefit of the doubt here. perhaps they can come to a compromise?

thanks for bringing up a different opinion.
the label owns her.
interwho? you mean the tubes? i thought they were clogged.
i would like to reference microsoft vs mikerowesoft here. while it never went to trial, it was crazy bad for ms and some hot shot lawyer had this to say:

i'm  big fan of the last generation (3g) of the ipod nano. the short square ones. i don't care much for the current versions. 

in fact, i like my 3g nano so much that i recently bought a brand new replacement ($120, 8 gigs, full warrantee- on ebay) to use when my current one finally dies. it's been flawless for two years now. i love the size and shape of it. solid as hell.

i killed several people in the name of jesus. therefore it is all jesus' fault.
she has great tits. 



that's all.
in that case, they were righteous deaths!
guitar ain't easy, and it isn't supposed to be. i've been playing for like a month and i've recently started listening to the beatles. like truly listening to them. i'm just wondering, does anyone know a song by them that could be easy to learn? just somewhere to get started.
i do not believe so. i think the dam's broken. the downloaders won't go back. music is quickly losing monetary value. more and more people are moving down this path. it's time to re-think the fair distribution of music.

edit: i don't believe sound quality is as important a factor as the financing of music.
they aren't doing it in her name, they are doing it representing her. you don't represent jesus. you're just a looney. her lawyers aren't. (well, i know, that's a matter of opinion) either way, it's not the same thing. chances are she signed the contract that gave the people representing her the ability to do such a thing.
however, jesus didn't hire you to kill those people, and jesus couldn't immediately stop you by simply asking you to. like i said before, katy perry is 100% responsible, and has the power to initiate, continue, or end these legal shenanigans:

&gt;fisher adams kelly, who were acting on behalf of katy perry...


if i, *as* jesus, sign a contract saying that you are *allowed* to kill people in my name, that doesn't make me responsible--you're still the one doing the killing. this is what the nuremberg trials were about. however, if i say that you *must* kill people in my name, and then you do, we are *both* responsible, i for ordering it and you for executing the order.
i've had a zune 30, 6th gen ipod, and a ipod touch.

6th gen is the best. zune software is the best for music management (1st party).
probably for the right price.
that's katy perry's real name.
but if you do kill people in jesus name, and he knows you're doing it, and doesn't ask you to stop doing it in his name, does that not make him, at least a little bit, responsible?

well according to most courts of law it does.

she signed a contract asking them to represent her in the manner that they are, and she knows they are doing it.

for example, a company contracts employees, the employees behave in a manner that is legally and or morally reprehensible while representing that company.  the company knows they are doing it and does nothing to stop the employee.

i can assure you that the employees would be criticised as well as the company. as they both should be, as they are both responsible.
i see the deep meaning in these lyrics.
i'd like to use her intellectual property laws...both of them...*ifyouknowhwatimean*
only if she abuses a cat will the internet come after her.

reporters have made "mistakes" in a story before to make it more controversial. i'm not saying she's not behind this, but it's fair to have patience for a day or so, and give her a chance to respond before we burn her for a witch.
somebody get that person a wire jumper kit.
strawberry fields? jk that might be tough, maybe im so tired
i screwed a girl and i liked it?
she later changed her surname to perry, which is the maiden of her mother, because "katy hudson" was too close to film actress kate hudson. (from wikipedia as well, times article reference seems legitimate)

i would hope she has no chance of winning this case but you never know these days.








do you think if katy perry asked her record company to stop they would?

i mean it's not as simple as just changing record labels if they're doing something you don't like (the stone roses come to mind). surely the singer is more of an employee in this case.
that poor 555.  what did it ever do to deserve such treatment?
i agree. i think downloading music might be the best thing that has happened to music. think about it. the record company makes most money off of record sales anyway, not the artist. artists make most money from shows (from what i hear at least) but, now artists can give away music for free, at a mass rate, and cut out the middle man (the record company) and be independent. blah blah blah... nothing you don't already know.

point being: this week, i downloaded 4 new albums of bands i haven't heard of (before hearing them on pandora), and i am going to buy tickets to see one of the bands shows. that band is going to make more money from me going to their show than if i bought their cd (which i would not have bought anyway). 
[and the datasheet on the sn76477](http://mkv.itm.miun.se/personal/per/diy/76477/sn76477datasheet.pdf)
i didn't say anything about the record company, who - with the best available information, at the moment - has nothing to do with this suit, which so far only involves katy perry, the law firm representing her, and the defendant.
i totally am : http://www.songkick.com/users/iheartmusic
how much did he pay you?
not like katy perry gets to choose who represents her or anything. poooooor rich artists...

nope, not the knife. thanks for putting it out there.
naah, i say "burn the witch."

who's with me?
those ladies do holler. thanks for taking a stab.
if her real name's katy hudson she should be suing the actress forcing her name change to katy horne.
that leaves teh door open for [jill sobule](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4r41vptf8k)to bring out the lawyers due to the theft of her cheeky gal pal title.
well the beatles are a great band to learn chords/chord progressions on because they use lots of them and sometimes with very quick transitions. some great ones to start with are hard days night and i want to hold your hand.

just focus on the rhythm for now. however if you really want to try picking, day tripper has an excellent beginners riff

any recommendations for a linux friendly device?

i had a sandisk sansa running rockbox, which was ok, but a bit of a struggle - i had difficulty getting it to recognize id3 tags (rockbox needs a certain version, which i set but it still didn't work right) and i wasn't such a big fan of the sansa hardware (the wheel and buttons didn't feel very natural).

i liked rockbox ok, but i'm not determined to use open source firmware - i'd just like the firmware to work well.  rockbox is great for ogg support and lots of other little features, but the menus were more confusing than i would have liked.  i would use it, but it's not a requirement.

i also thought managing the sansa by mounting it a bit cumbersome.  i know there are linux tools for managing ipods, but i've never owned one so i don't know what they're like.

any thoughts on using any music players with linux would be appreciated!
that's actually pretty cool.  have a link to where i can order one?


i love the ocean. great song. 
at the end he tries to equate the whole thing to racism... that's kind of dumb.
record labels sign artists to short contracts these days, and when was the last time a label successfully sued an artist for canceling their tour?

this isn't a bunch of robots we're talking about. they have to deal with artists in person. they also have to be careful how they interact with radio stations due to payola laws and recent (long overdue) legal action on so-called independent promotion practices. 

in short, because much of what drives sales is out of the label's hands, an angry artist is free to do all sorts of violence to their own sales, then provide the label with probably one more record and move on. if memory serves, this is why nine inch nails' *broken* was so damned good. it was designed to get him thrown off his label.
we've done four already but now we're steady and then they went—one, two, three, four!
man, i listen to that song about fifteen times daily it seems. i've been learning the whole thing on guitar, just got the outro solo down. absolutely love that song. 
i'm almost certain there's already a band using that name. what about *the london enormous raging cunt sack uk*? has a nice ring to it, right?
cunt.
and really, whoever heard of a flash in the pan celebrity extending her shelf life by converting her name into a fashion brand?
i have a vision for a band that i want to start, which i want to be a combination of primus, frank zappa, and bebop/hard bop a la mingus and blakey.  i would be playing guitar.

i've been listening to naked city a good bit lately, and bands like curlew, cul de sac, and channel 23.

my point was more that you can't really switch record labels,  for example stone roses couldn't release music for 5 years while their previous record label tried to sue the crap out of their new record label. if you were outraged enough sure you could tank your sales, but if you're label is only being mildly dickish why ruin your sales. it's not like the girl has scruples.

solid piece of kit for a car, not so much for carrying around in your pocket.

i also have a 1st gen nano with rockbox for that... ;)


depends if they've trademarked the name already in that class for the sake of merchandise.
i'm not sure, it really depends on the aussie laws to how strict they are.

the usual check is the 'idiot in a hurry' test. if an idiot in a hurry can tell the difference between two products with a similar name there's no infringement. in this case, there might be.

trademark laws are there to protect the public after all.
what does that have to with anything?  assuming she doesn't own the rights, she sold the rights to them under conditions she agreed to. and the people she sold the rights to are representing her. i am well aware of how the music industry works.

selling control over what people do in your name doesn't absolve you of responsibility for it. without you, they couldn't have done it in the first place. and she always has the option of publicly denouncing what her lawyers are doing in her name.  which i don't see her rushing to do.

bands that have disagreed with the actions of their record companies have been known to speak out in the past. it concerns her, why hasn't she? maybe because she supports people doing shady litigation in her name? or she cares so little about it she lets it go on? it smears her name, which gives her at least some of the responsibility for correcting it.
look, if you start "bloodythorn" inc, and then sell the company, how long past that are you personally liable for what people do with the company?

"katy perry" is pretty much a fictional character at this point. very few of these pop artists write any of their own material, and their recordings are so overproduced that you or i could have been the ones to "sing" into the mic and they would have gotten the same sound on the album. everything that is katy perry is a corporate produced product, and now, that corporation is being a bit over the top in protecting its trademark. this happens all the time. expecting the woman who prances around on stage and lip syncs to even know this is going on is a bit unrealistic, she lives in a fucking bus, and dances around on stage for a living. she's probably the least up to date person connected to any of this. 
if what you say is true;

"she's probably the least up to date person connected to any of this."

then she has yet another responsibility to her public image she is not upholding.

and to rebuke your comment about this being like selling off a corporation; she didn't sell it off, she isn't even working for it, they are working for her, regardless of how much power she gave them by contract. she isn't disconnected from it in the same way a former owner of a company would be disconnected from actions taken by the company currently.

again, i am well aware how the music industry works, please don't try to yank my chain on it by providing examples that aren't even remotely close.
lynyrd skynyrd, miss 'em!
frank zappa.

*and the mother's of invention (who aren't all dead).
look, a great many people sell their companies or brands and then continue to work for the new owners. there's nothing wrong with it. when you sign a record deal, thats exactly what you've gone and done. they don't work for you, you work for them, and anybody who deludes themselves otherwise does so at their peril.

when you've got a multinational corporation telling you which guitar pedals from which brands you'll be using from now on, you'll understand who is the employee and who is the employer. 

you seem have a few misconceptions about how the music industry works. and while they are fairly common misconceptions, they are still misconceptions. when you sign a record contract you are not "selling your company". it is not a very accurate analogy.

and i am not sure that anything i provide will clear this up for you.  it doesn't make for a productive discussion.

thanks for the responses though.

american dates please please please......
no. i think the trend to electronic storage is pretty well established. cds are nice and all but with the advent of gigabyte and terabyte storage, they've become unnecessary.

additionally, record labels have only ever been useful for their ability to promote and distribute on a large scale. digital content and the internet have undermined this leverage. record labels are becoming an unnecessary middleman.

regardless, i feel that format is independent of price, quality, and content.

have to agree with this review. i think the unfortunate truth is this album got great pity reviews. it is not great, and certainly is not what dmb does best. it is basically a generic pop rock record, and there is nothing wrong with pop rock, but that is not their forte. the songs all sound kinda generic, where is the character that songs like two step, don't drink the water, and bartender bring to the table? 
that's the thing with trademarks though. you have to protect your name and go after those who use it. i mean, sure katy perry's name is a stage name, but hearing the name is more associated with the singer than the business owner.

the business owner has much more to gain by using that name at this point. it can be seen as an attempt to profit off of another person's success and brand. 

there are a lot of things that aren't answered in the article. like whether or not she can continue selling designs under a different name. it sounds like she could, just not with a trademark similar to that of katy perry's. i mean, they're left out so the person who is in fact in the wrong gains empathy from other people.

if katie perry wanted her name and business protected, she should have filed for a trademark when she decided it was going to a business, and according to the article, that was over two years ago. if she did that, the roles would be reversed right now, as katy perry wasn't an internationally known artist at that period of time. 


katie perry isn't the victim, and no one should think she is, regardless of the tone the article presents the story.

reading it is like hearing a sob story by a child molester. 
good choice between the two i think.

ian curtis.
mother of god
robert johnson, in some run down honky-tonk in mississippi.  an abundance of whiskey would be nice too. 

why: he influenced so many artists that i enjoy, i want to see the original.
it is very rare to see a band reunite after 12 years and have their performance be as good as ever. _totally up to my fucking standards!_

faith no more is a very underrated band. great to see them back and yes they should come to us!

choices in order

1. john lenon / the beatles

2. brad nowell / sublime

3. kurt cobain / nirvana

4. mozart

5. jim morisson / the doors

i had great luck with a meizu miniplayer. i've had mine for about 3 years now without any issues. even reads oggs, flacs, and aac files, as well as video and pictures.

edit:

oh yeah, and it's like a portable hard drive, but it reads the id3 tags of all the files you put on it. works great in linux.  copy/paste, or sync with amarok or the like.
"weird fishes" off in rainbows is amazing to "bang" to.
bob marley.
looks like i hit a nerve up there? anyway i'm pretty sure you're right as far as us trademark law is concerned, don't know about australia. 

my comment was actually half serious: i think she may know she has a losing claim, but hope for a settlement which might reward her nothing now but protect her ability to use her name for product lines later down the road which kat*ie* might otherwise be able to block.
do you want jimi by himself or would you want to bring one of his bands back too? if so i'd definitely go with the [band of gypsys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/band_of_gypsys) over [experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_jimi_hendrix_experience). just listen to [who knows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sap861ndb8w) or [machine gun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svvtis2ygvi&amp;feature=related). the experience is great, but the band of gypsys is like a kick to the chest!
mike looks like a motherfucking, grade-a pimp to me.
warren zevon
my first concert was queen on the news of the world tour (i was 14 and made my dad take me).  good choice.
beatles or the doors. or richard farina. 

hard to decide. these people don't seem to live as long as they should. 
upvoted for the hilarity.

hm.

lynyrd skynyrd's still around. in fact they're playing with styx next week.
in no particular order:

* zappa
* zevon
* hendrix
* mercury
* lennon
* bonham, but only if it really reunited zeppelin
roskilde festival 2009 ! oh yeah !!
it's amazing that in almost 5 minutes, the camera never once pans to billy gould on bass. 
&gt;roy orbison. he's so soulful. he was from texas, which is so suppressive emotionally and yet he was so emotional. he was a unique individual. it's too bad he had to pass so soon.

texas is emotionally suppressive...?  what the fuck?
i love all the rock stuff on here, but i'd have to say charlie parker.

i know it's an odd choice, but i'm not hugely enamored with the classics, so most of the bands/artists i really care about are still alive.

i discovered that the author's e-mail address is not working correctly, so i'll post my note here in hopes that he/she'll be watching this forum (i hope)...

&gt;mn,
&gt;
&gt;i really enjoyed your article about the origins of the musical sentence signifying the far east.  i'm always interested in the semiotics of music - especially in how it's used in film scores.  anyway, there's another phrase that's become a cliche, although it's not often used anymore - only this one signifies the american indian.  i'm nowhere near a keyboard or instrument, so i'm winging it, but i'll try to describe it like this:

&gt;c for half beat | b flat below it for quarter note | c above for eighth note | b flat below for eighth note | c above for eighth note | b flat below for eighth note | f sharp below for quarter note | f sharp for half note.
&gt;
&gt;my tones may not be 100% spot on, but i believe i have the rhythm ok.  anyway, i thought it might be an interesting project to discover the etymology of that particular phrase.  you hear it a lot in westerns films from the 50's and 60's and in john wayne westerns.
&gt;
&gt;thanks for the interesting article!


what's with the cane?
joe strummer for a clash reunion would be the tits.
miles davis no question.
for the record, i didn't downmod you.  you make an interesting point with regard to katy perhaps hoping for a settlement.
unfortunately their 'unstoppable' tour has been canceled...
beethoven, he'd tear that shit up! the string breaker strikes again!
running a legit fashion business is like molesting a child?  you live in a strange place.
my dad.
nina simone. a quiet club that has a secret stock of good whiskey. the place is half full of silent and stunned regulars. she sings with full knowledge that she will return to her grave at midnight. it is a night that changes my life.
i actually prefer *the london philharmonic enormous raging cunt sack*
in no particular order... 

john cage,
john coltrane,
don drummond (incredible trombonist for the skatalites, went mad, killed his wife, and died by age 33),
king tubby (dub legend),
syd barrett,
max roach,
thelonious monk,

out of those already mentioned, hendrix, miles davis, charlie parker, frank zappa, lennon, marley, and bonham would all be much appreciated.

also, mitch mitchell.
low is one of my favorite bands.  here is my obligatory "other recommendations" post:

swans

current 93

einsturzende neubauten

death in june

coil

nurse with wound

she should just change her name to "tits mcgee"
this video took me so off guard. they did a surprisingly good job of that song. i would have loved to have been there. canadian dates perhaps? guys? please..?
i'm with you.
i don't think i ever expected einsturzende neubauten to come up related to low, but it actually fits pretty decently (at least their recent, less industrial stuff).
actually, i'm just more upset that they didn't pick brahms last month.
i think it is a pretty tightly knit network of artists.  if someone listens to one of them, chances are they listen to a few of the others, or have at least heard of them.
jeff buckley.
there was a site that used this song and the weather of the location of your ip address to determine fractal pattern of flash page.  i cant seem to find it though :(
frank zappa.
nick drake
i missed out on getting tickets for the brixton show; gutted!  saw them there on the angel dust tour, and a couple of other times before that.  hoping for more dates.
devil in the white city taught me that
i love the band, and i'm very sorry i missed the whole weekend as it actually had a very good, genuine metal line-up (uncommon for recent metal festivals).
even 20 years later, most male fnm fans still want to suck mike patton off.
possibly. this is the first time i've seen anyone connect low to industrial music. the only reason i know those bands is that i used to be really into ebm and all that. 

it's a really interesting comparison.
that was absolutely horrible. 
the doors. if i could see any band live throughout the entirety of our history it would have to be the doors. the day i got to listen to "the end" on jim morrison grave is still one of the most insightful and satisfying experiences i have ever had.  
i would love to see spinal tap play with their original drummer before his "accident".
boosh boosh
stronger than a moose
there are way better live recordings of this that i've heard. this one is crap, and doesn't nearly do it justice.
my friends whent to this, no one invited me though.
this is a beautiful song. i love the subtle noise in between the achingly beautiful pads...
rio karma!
i opened and repaired it several times, it felt from waist height to hard asphalt even more often and i get "what the hell is that?" all the time.

if only one could transfer files via normal usb storage media something and not with the stupid proprietary stuff.
what you've just described is awesome, way to leave me hanging 
care to post a link?  i hadn't heard it before and rather thought it was good, considering the poor quality.
can't really search for it right now. it's been a while. there a couple good ones with taylor singing/dave drumming.

also this was on the mi:ii soundtrack so there's a studio version floating around somewhere
haha i'm really sorry, i have been googling for it all day.
i miss the poofy haired guitar player with the lightning
hadn't seen that particular masterpiece, but i'll have to find that track.  thanks!
never seen it either, but i remember it from radio airplay
really cool song and the video ain't bad either
weird al has a very simple, very silly shtick, but he does it with good humor and genuine talent.  that's worthy of respect.  
i'd kill to see soul coughing again.

are you by any chance from the twin cities? i guess for some strange reason, we were their largest fan base.
very cool song from a great guy. i saw him play in a club, live with a band 2 years ago and it was fantastic. one of the best sets i have ever had the joy to experience. if you like this you should try and pick up his live cd he put out last year. his dj sets are ok with pretty rad track selection (see his essential mix) but live is where it is at for me.

fifty dollars or more!
yeah, it's really nice, and not even one of my favourite tracks from the album!  i highly recommend anyone who enjoyed this (who doesn't already have it) [check it out](http://www.amazon.com/the-last-resort/dp/b000znrct4/ref=sr_f3_2?ie=utf8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1245277912&amp;sr=103-2).  it's probably in itunes too if you can find your ø key in order to search...
hey, i thought it was funny.
believe the video was created by robert hodgin aka [flight404](http://www.flight404.com). one of the founders of [barbarian group](http://www.barbariangroup.com/) and i believe developed of the latest itunes visualizers... if not, they sure were inspired by robert.
thanks for posting this.
what a fest!!! the crazy thing- i went to so many shows, but they were so different than your lineup!

though i was in close proximity to you during phish sunday.
this is awesome.

when you can, can you upload the full footage of each of the concerts (starting with phoenix/the decemberists).

that would be unbelievably awesome. 
you can see the whole set on youtube. goddamn rocking!
i freaking love trentemøller! great find!
no...afraid not. i'm from cleveland. but i do know that doughty's *smofe &amp; smang* was recorded there...that's gotta count for something.
which one?

kurt cobain, i'm watching classic albums - nevermind right now.... that album changed everything.
i saw this and realized it was just a visualizer plugin too
sublime, mainly because bradley never got to see how successful his music became.  i think it would be cool to give him one night where he sees what a huge impact he has made on this world and revel in it.  
wahhhhhh!
this guy's a big influence on my band.
thanks for this. i really wanted to go but i'm stuck inside all summer studying for the bar. it was cool to be able to see what it was like. great post!
i just so happen to have the ost!

let me upload somewhere. 

http://drop.io/foocigar
thanks man! you should definitely check it out if you haven't been already. there was all sorts of craziness when you coupled all of the music with camping, psychedelic freakshows, and people staying up until 6am raving it up.
yeah i have been to a few big festies but not roo. next summer i'm gonna do it big, maybe even go in a fuckin' rv!
wat
okay... where's the rest?
say what you will about the smashing pumpkins today, but i put gish in the same category as bringing it all back home, sunshine superman, sticky fingers, la woman and led zeppelin iv
wow, that was neat. american dates would be splendid. haven't seen them since the break up.
the pumpkins shredded back then. i love siamese dream, too. after that... not so impressed.

if you had posted rite of spring i would have started a riot in the shopping mall.

just saying.
a for effort.
i was sort of expecting a climax...

great piece, though.
great peeping tom anyone?
i can tell you where i was the day reagan was shot: my mom's hoohah (i was born that day)
wow they look like shit.
i think the problem was that billy corgan moved from being a great musician to a pop personality\*.  i think a lot gets lost in translation.  
  
\* circa mellon collie and the infinite sadness - which i though was pretty decent, overall, but really, the beginning of the end
i met tim kinsella once at an owls show and i told him i appreciated just about everything he has ever done, to which he replied, "i dont know, i have done some pretty terrible things. like sometimes at work, when someone orders a bloody marry, i just refuse to serve them."
i think like  j. d. salinger he had just one incredibly great novel in him, instead of 10 okay ones
check out this track by trentemoller :)   
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0q3r7c7pdk
only the end is the beginning of the end..
billy corgan becomes more ducebaggy as he loses hair. 
i have to agree.  this and cherub rock are my favorite sp tunes -- top 10 all time, perhaps.
yeah bonnaroo was definitely worth the 15 hours from toronto! i will probably do it too again next year.
which album? i like siamese dream the most. and haha maybe there's something to that, but i don't think salinger is quite the best example for billy corgan. billy corgan fights for the spotlight when his high time has passed.. salinger had a bit of a different reaction.
a thing begins to end the moment it begins...
one of my favorite songs. sometimes it almost makes me cry.
mark sandman of/and morphine....


...because they fucking rock!
one of the few accordion virtuosos in the world.
you were up close for a lot of shows - hardcore! rodrigo y gabriela were definitely a pleasant surprise.
right, but gish was his catcher in the rye
you all need to go back and listen to adore.
pretty lights are sweet. 
he looks like [sleazy p. martini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sleazy_p._martini).
lawyers are jerks, news at 11.
it's a simile. the situation isn't equivalent in extremity, but the point is that she's treated as a victim even though she's the one infringing trademark.

someone is in the wrong, and it isn't katy perry's lawyers. 
i know, they usually eat frogs, but this one kept going after that ladybug.
it kept freaking me out.
the phoenix show was so incredible. i've been listening to them ever since.
didn't really regret missing it last year except mmj and sigur ros, whom i got to see at boa pavilion that summer anyway, but really feeling i missed out on it this year right now.  nice video.  
how late were you able to stay in your tent in the mornings?
