==============================	
definitely not obvious.  it doesn't happen enough to be obvious.
i read the comments on this thread hoping for some intellectual conversation about the future of us soccer ...and we're talking about pissing toothpaste. 
&gt;telling me through laws and actions that i need welfare more than another race? that we need scholarships that are specifically for my race? that we qualify for housing that other races don't?
that is basically the "harm to beneficiaries objection," and it is one based on meritocracy—something that we do not have in this country (i do think they are not geared toward empowerment, though, which i touch on below). if there were equal opportunities and institutionalized racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, albleism, cissexism, etc. was non-existent, i would agree with you. but that type of institutional inequality is still widespread, despite it being more effectively concealed.
[this is basically how i feel about those policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xisihrnqlqo)—they are part of "healing the wound." with institutional inequality, still the "knife" hasn't even been pulled out yet. also for what it's worth, it's been shown that whites will use this harm to beneficiaries objection to protect their own racial group's self-interest (e.g., oppose affirmative action and say that it's because it undermines those who it is trying to help, but really it's motivated by self-interest of one's own privileged racial group).
sports politics
==============================	
&gt;those are the real racists.
as i cited malcolm x above, he was also pretty critical of white liberals, too. he makes a pretty cogent argument, as well. basically: white liberals get votes by saying shit is gunna change and it never does. i agree with that. but i don't buy the fox news argument that liberals are the "real racists." it has no empirical evidence, and imo it's just fox news trying to make themselves not look like all of the shit they promote doesn't protect the white, christian, male, heterosexual, cisgender, able-bodied, upper-class status quo, when in reality it does.
&gt;i don't need somebody that has never stepped foot in the ghetto, never been a minority
many proponents of these policies have.
&gt;not laws that enable us to keep up this vicious cycle of poverty, and thus, crime. it's done nothing but make people reliant and complacent.
sports politics
==============================	
with the way that welfare is run currently, yeah it does create a vicious cycle. yeah, there needs to be more of an angle of empowerment, although from those that i've talked to and been around, i don't get a sense of people being complacent as much as a sense of stuck in the vicious cycle.
&gt;what we need is to break the chains of contempt
how do we do this, then?
dude... the number decreases, the reaction time increases, your patronizing me when you're wrong... and you're making yourself look bad

you want the shortest reaction time possible for quicker reflexes.
if it takes me 5 minutes to walk to the shop that's a *quicker* *time* than if it had taken me 10 minutes to walk the exact same distance. "reaction time" is literally the time taken to react to an event.
50ms is a faster reaction time than 100ms.
100ms is a greater (larger) reaction time than 50ms.

why did they put an italian clapping dog on a soccer team?
i always read it this way:
the force was too far to the light side, and then palpatine rose up, shifting it too far to the dark, where it continued to tilt during the clone wars.  it shifted precipitously when anakin became vader and slaughtered the younglings, and order 66 was given to destroy the rest of the jedi.
the deaths of the jedi masters were not through anakin's actions, thus, those could not be *him* bringing balance to the force.  
anakin skywalker didn't return balance to the force until he killed the emperor - the darkest of the dark - in return of the jedi.

i doubt she was being racist but she should stop addressing tables as "boys."  "guys" is a much better casual option. boys can come off as demeaning or at least out of place (like if its a young girl talking to older men). people get offended by stupid shit. some women get offended if you address a group including women as "you guys." this is the assinie bullshit you have to learn to deal with while in the service industry. 
this isn't an excuse for not tipping though. if sapp wants to be treated an respected as a man he should act like one. a grown man should have no problem saying "hey, 'serversname', we don't really like being called boys, do you mind using a different phrase?" rather than writing a snide note on his check and stiffing the girl after taking up a table in her section for a few hours. 
sports politics
==============================	
i didn't know and still don't know if they mean ice cream,  whipped cream or that other stuff that is like milk. 
stop pretending that you knew that.  you clearly didn't.  why would anyone ask the question you just did if he or she knew the answer?
when he does something bad, hes scottish, when hes achieved something, hes british
agree w/ you on everything, i can imagine in a rush like i'm sure they had for the world cup that saying "hey boys" didn't even cross her mind. it's sapp could have defused the situationionally w/ some humor maybe "i don't see any boys at this table" ... he just took the wrong route and let it stew.

the question is stupid and english is annoying.
how do your eat your strawberries ? technically the answer is with his hands
what do you eat them with ? (expecting 'cream') could be answered with "my mouth"

is this the normal way to ask this question in the uk? in america it would be more like "what do you eat with your strawberries?" 
do you think this was an intentional anti-joke?
fun fact strawberries aren't actually berries. they're pseudofruits.

everyone is just trying to explain to you that you're wrong. speed and time are inversely related. when speed increases, the time it takes to do something decreases.

eh still the champ until someone else wins, just like spain is still the wc holder.
that sort of inexcusable ignorance can haunt you for life, my friend.  he was right to delete the comment before future employers and/or spouses could see it.
i thought they were wondering what process they took to consume the strawberries. i was gonna say i separate the leaves and eat everything else.
and pretty funny
i've worked in the service industry for my whole working life. i disagree that there is no excuse for not tipping. i am extremely polite to servers and service people because of my own experiences. when i go out to a restaurant i tip 20% if you are nice and do your job. i tip 15% if we have problems with the order. if you are rude and we have problems with the order, then i'll blow you up and you can forget about a tip. shoot, i tip on to go orders because i realize how important tips are. 
sports politics
==============================	
warren sapp said the server was very rude to them, etc. he met the story head on. i have no reason to believe he's a liar.
the point is if you're outright rude to me, which you must admit we have all experienced, then i'm not going to give you extra money because i'm obliged.
yeah i had no clue. i just thought it was one of those questions asked in those "what's your favorite yada yada" segments
yeah man, you never hear them mentioned like you do the alex rider books. i never liked other spy books that much, but i really liked the characters in cherub. still got the em sitting in my room at 19 years old. fancy a nostalgic re-read now :)
so he is still the champ for the next few days?

edit: what's wrong with the word fancy? i'm not a native speaker, am i right in assuming that it's mostly used in an ironic way?

look, just because i can't think of another example of something that changes consistency and flavour when you process it doesn't mean they aren't different things.

whipped cream and cream might be the same thing, but there is still a significant difference. you can't put cream on top of a drink as decoration for example.

i don't think it's exclusively a british thing, but it a common occurrence here, especially around wimbledon, as served traditionally with cream.

because this is the third time in a row he has done it. each time he does it, he plays it down shrugs it off and makes like it's no big deal. he has already been suspended twice for it, and those were wrist slaps. he has no reason to believe that they would actually punish him for it.

it would sound like a normal way to ask the question if you were used to eating strawberries prepared in various ways.

you used it correctly. you are correct that fancy is often used ironically a lot now though, because being "fancy" is not trendy anymore. americans think of pompous and unnecessary things when we think "fancy".

i would argue racing puts more of a physical stress that is more associated with being an athletic event than competitive eating.  having raced around a track in a fire suit and a helmet for an hour, it is pretty grueling and demanding really, but not near as demanding as say.....soccer or something where you are running non-stop etc.

&gt;don't take the words too literally. look for the spirit behind the language. else you might miss the point of a lot of things. this isn't a scientific journal, it's a casual thread in a sports sub page of an entertainment website.
i agree with this concept.  however, like i said before, i'm not a mind reader.  many times, the only way to figure out the spirit of what someone said is to question them or to counter points they've made.
if someone says something that doesn't hold water (i.e. this thing that is top 10% in the world is average) and you call them out, they can do one of two things.  
admit that it was poor word choice and didn't really reflect their views and then clarify what you really meant.
or take the stance that you meant what you said in the first place and that everyone else are the ones with the problem.
sports programming
==============================	
if he had done the first, i think we would have been in complete agreement and moved on after 1-2 posts.
instead, he wanted to be obstinate, dig in his heels, and double down on a stance that isn't supportable by any rational definition of the word "average". 
he is free to do that, but then the issue isn't that i am unwilling to look at the spirit of his message.  the issue is that he would rather double down on something that isn't actually his message as opposed to admitting his initial word choice was shit.
i'm not sure how that is on me.  i can only go on what you say.  if you say something that doesn't hold water as stated and i call you on it, and you say over and over that it does hold water, then all i can do is assume that it is in fact your actual message, no matter how stupid it is.

even if you were to argue that there is no reason to pay for something you can download for free - some players in the industry actually often manage to disprove this by doing things right. buying games on steam, for example, is often more convenient than pirating them, and offers other advantages as well (save-games stored in the cloud etc).

woa woa woa, i remember watching a segment on good morning america about 3-d printing. from what i say it looked like pastic toys they were printing. is 3-d printing that advance that you can recreates operational firearms and manufacture other operational products, i.e electronics????
i'm really impressed with what you guys (all the manufactures) have been up to lately. however i do have one concern.

how are you guys handling the extra maintenance attached to turbo engines? spin down time, the extra wear on oil. how do you guys handle warranty claims for people who just don't understand turbo vehicles?

 i heard somewhere gm had a cooling setup on their turbo that allows the coolant to flow through the turbo even after the engines off due to a convection current. i don't know much about fords but i just became a mazda tech so i assume i'll learn a whole bunch in the coming future

since you can't 3-d print a gun, i would disagree.  until you can print a barrel, which is likely decades away at least, you can't print a gun.
the way patents work is by excluding others from doing what you've patented in the way you've patented it. you don't have to be the innovator, you just have to be the patent holder. if someone profits by infringing upon your patent, you're entitled to those profits and to order a cease and desist. in general terms.

good on anonvas for analyzing this. i’ll point out a few initial considerations and issues i think are relevant when considering this act: 


**supreme court.** the filipino supreme court has not yet ruled on whether to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the implementation of this law. although the court convened, they want more time to review petitions, and they will apparently issue a decision next tuesday (october 9, 2012). that’s important because the supreme court’s decision will have the effect of law and can stop this act from being implemented. we need to wait for them to make a decision before anything else can be done. however, until then, the act may be and likely is enforceable.   [source](http://www.philstar.com/article.aspx?articleid=855169&amp;publicationsubcategoryid=63)

technology politics
==============================	

**caselaw.** it would be useful to see what kind of standards are applied for libel cases similar to those that may occur online. these would be cases involving newspapers, magazines, open letters, as well as private communications, and more specifically, any case involving article 355 since the act specifically refers to that article in reference to libel. also important, what case law exists for the standards to be applied? libel, as defined in article 353 of the penal code, is only the starting point in determining defamation. the whole of title thirteen, chapter one of the penal code deals with libel and should be read as a whole. the philippines have a civil law system, so caselaw is not as important- but, courts apparently follow the supreme court’s decisions as stare decisis. so any cases dealing with the standards applied to libel should be evaluated.  


**criminal/civil procedure.** the philippines have a civil law system and certainly have their own unique criminal and civil procedure. i’m not familiar with filipino legal procedure at all, but it’s important to consider it in relation to this act. the act states in several places “any person found guilty...” (see, e.g., sec. 8 penalities). now, the questions of how and when a person is found guilty hinge directly on the form of criminal procedure in place. for example... what standards do police use/need to arrest a person? what rights do citizens have to an attorney once arrested? how do filipino police departments process new cases?  
technology programming
==============================	


**international law.** article ii, section 2 of the philippine constitution expressly provides that filipino law adopts “generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land.” [source.](http://www.chanrobles.com/article2.htm#.ugspxjhjjj0) the cyber crime act is targeting information and data on the internet. the internet, obviously, isn’t some self-contained thing that is purely a domestic matter. that means other nations *should* have an interest in this law. if the filipino supreme court does nothing, and the act is put into place as is, there will likely be some backfire from other nations. that’s where international law may play a part. while chapter vi, section 22 (international cooperation) of the act is probably meant to expand investigatory power, in a way, it might limit the act’s full potential. consider that section 22 gives “full force and effect” to “all relevant international instruments...” and put that in conjunction with article ii of the constitution. this should give the international community room to negotiate or challenge the act- that is, if anyone in the international community cares. but i believe an act of this type, with such heavy restrictions and expansive coercive powers, should give other nations pause for concern. 


technology politics
==============================	

**actual practice.** the philippines may have a fully functioning government that is efficiently run, without corruption, and protective of its citizens. but they would be unique in the world if they do have such a government. with that said, the actual practice of law officials and the implementation of the law at the case-level makes a big difference here. because cyber law is a relatively new field, many governments are already doing the things detailed in this act. what this law does is to institutionalize, formalize, and legitimize those actions. the big question now is how will this law be used in practice? will it be a coercive tool used to suppress criticism? or will it be used to track malicious hackers and spammers? who knows- i’ve only seen one instance (not fully verified) of an alleged threat from a police officer's (or a department’s) facebook page. so yes, there is potential for corruptive use of this act, however, actual practice must be taken into account.


if there are more specific questions about what this law does and what the implications are, i'm sure i could look more into it later. for now, just wanted to give some observations.

the problem for mr. wilson is that with his setup, he has the ability to produce a gun per day or several guns per day on industrial equipment.  "common sense" tells you that this is much more like a "guns for sale" setup rather than a home hobbyist.  (there is also the issue that he appears to have "outside investors" in the project which makes it look even more like a commercial manufacturing set-up - they may technically expect nothing in return for the money (i don't know one way or the other) but it's a "common sense" reason for the atf to look at this situation skeptically.)

i'm sure that underpinning what is going on is a desire to push back disruptive technology, and i sure as hell don't understand the legal issues.  but i'd say that there is enough very real "gray area" to make "putting the brakes" on this project seem not unreasonable.
which you can already do with a cnc machine for less money, but most criminals would rather buy a stolen or illegally imported gun for $200 on the street then pay $20,000 for a 3d printer to make a single shot gun.
yes, lumen equivalence.  in the united states people are used to incandescent bulbs and know that 100 watts is "really bright" and 40 watts is "moderately bright" but couldn't tell you how many lumens those lights put out.  so our cfls and leds are all rated as an equivalent to an incandescent wattage (in addition to lumens).

he may or may not know better. the cynical side in me says that he doesn't and this is how he is. my positive side believes that he knows what he's doing and the producers are pushing an image, which he runs with because he makes a lot of money off of it. i think by this point we all know that reality tv is anything but. 

many people want to be cops, but can't because they don't have the mental or physical abilities. other times, cops become bondsmen because they can make far more money doing it than being cops, plus they have connections in the police department to help them. one of the top bondsman in my city is an ex sheriff and he does very well.

technology politics
==============================	
i'm not familiar with dog's legal status, but in my state, you can't have a felony and be a bondsman without getting special permission from the department of insurance. it depends on the charge really. someone convicted for breach of trust isn't going to get one, but someone with perhaps a felony dui would probably qualify. 

many of those criminals aren't bad people. they have reasons for being in trouble, whether drugs, socio-economic issues, etc. there is kind of an honor amongst thieves. that and it helps to have a relationship with a bondsman for when you get in trouble in the future. my boss had a couple of clients that were second generation with him, both parent and child got in trouble and used him. most will actually pay too if you set up some kind of payment plan. we even had one where his wife came in an finished paying after he was convicted and sent to prison. many of these people aren't "bad people", they've just made dumb choices. also many aren't the brightest bulb on the tree, which goes to explaining how they got where they are. i would put dog on the lower end closer to the shady types than at the pinnacle of the industry, but he seems to run a legitimate business. he just doesn't do it in the best way based on what i have seen. what you see on tv and what happens in real life are two different things though. 

i've never felt my life was in danger, but i also stayed away from things like attempted murder, armed robbery, rape, etc. i may have cut out some of the higher bonds and money, but i also went home every night. the type to do stuff like that also tended to be the ones that tilted towards sociopathy, while most of the other stuff was just dumb decisions. 
technology politics
==============================	

i never saw or heard about anyone doing anything but run, but every decade or so, someone in my city gets killed trying to capture someone. it's not always the shady types though, it happens to good ones. the risk is higher than your average person, but there are steps you can take like i described in earlier posts that can help limit and minimize those risks. i value my life over $100,000. i'd rather let someone get away than die trying to capture them. 

self defense doesn't work when you bust into someones house. you're the intruder. that's why i was saying it's best to let the cops do stuff like that since that is their job and the law is on their side when the person has a warrant. they also have the training that most people lack. all the civil and criminal laws still apply to a bail bondsman picking someone up, although there tend to be laws that allow a little more leeway. but again, much of this rests on a case decided well over 100 years ago. the best way is to limit your risks and don't write sketchy bonds. from the cases i have read about, if a bondsman goes in and things go south, he or she would likely be civilly and potentially criminally liable.

technology movies
==============================	

big-endian and little-endian refer to the order in which large numbers are stored in memory, analogous to whether you write today's date "10/2" or "2/10".  some cpus are called bi-endian if they can support either.

most powerpc chips are big-endian, and also have a "pseudo" little-endian mode (which was mostly normal little-endian, with some caveats when interfacing with external i/o devices).  mac os has always run powerpc chips in big-endian mode.

technology programming
==============================	
intel x86 and x64 are little-endian.  (not surprisingly, microsoft windows also ran in little-endian mode when on powerpc and other bi-endian processors, like mips and itanium.)

microsoft used to have a mac version of virtualpc, a virtual machine that let the user run x86 software, including windows, on their mac.  this program used the little-endian mode of the powerpc, naturally.

apple's "powerpc g5" chips (the ibm powerpc 970 series) dropped support for the g4's little-endian mode.  thus, for a time, microsoft's virtualpc wouldn't run at all on apple's newest macs.

so lets see.  your solution is "require background checks on _all_ the sales!", but what is the problem?  it seems the problem as you sarcastically described in your earlier comment is that of private sales allowing firearms dealers to avoid background checks.  

that "problem" is not well thought out though.  if a dealer is just going to lie and say that a sale is a private sale to get around a background check, then why would they not simply just lie and say the sale never occurred?  they could even file the serial numbers off and give a full-package illegal sale.  all you'd be doing by requiring background checks on private sales is force them to use a better and more effective lie...

technology music
==============================	

one could argue that the content owner is less the money they would have received had said person bought the song instead. contrarily however, they've only actually lost a **potential** sale, so it's just as arguable that said copier may well have never bought said song regardless whether copying was an option or not. additionally, this doesn't even account for instances where copying has lead to more sales by virtue of allowing potential purchasers to demo the full product before deciding whether it's worth the purchase or not.

copying is not the same as stealing. it's a murky grey area that has it's benefits and negatives, for **both** sides. right now you have content owners decrying copying, claiming lost revenue, yet being completely unable to provide provable tangible numbers of said supposed lost revenue. the issue is far more complex than simply one copy equaling one lost sale.

no, especially not sintered titanium.  you might be able to make a really thick barrel that would last a few shots.  barrels are made out of hard, strong steel.  the shape of the rifling is not easy to produce, and for any kind of long gun, a special drilling machine is needed.

the earth does cast a shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse (as seen from earth). i suppose that's a solar eclipse from the moon, with the earth doing the eclipsing. anyway, it goes as dark as night on earth when there is a solar eclipse, so as there is no atmosphere on the moon, i'd expect the area of shadow to be even darker than here.

this is probably the most blatant violation of privacy that faces americans today. this is the government saying, "we know you want your cell phones, we know you need them. but, if you're going to carry one then you shouldn't expect us to not snoop on you." so, next if the government wants to turn on the microphone on your cell phone and listen to your private conversations, that becomes a pretty easily justified extension of their right to track your location. i don't know how to put it any clearer, the government wants you to be afraid of it. they want you to be afraid of doing anything that might even slightly threaten their standing as the supreme overseers of your life. they want you to know that they are tracking you, or at least that they might be. that makes you much more likely to be a good little sheep.

good point. my first, easy technical solution would be to run high surface area pipes under the soil to pipe water through. this would be similar to an atmospheric water cooling system, but would need to be much larger since the surface contact of the soil is going to be much less than air would be and be a pretty effective insulation. another way would be a massive infra-red generating cooling plate to bleed it off into space.

technology politics
==============================	
going higher tech, you could use thermoelectric generators, like peltier coolers or sterling engines to transform the heat into kinetic or electrical energy. possibly use this to power a communication laser, or feed the electricity back into the system. this is just making the chip more energy efficient though, so i'm pretty sure that you are going to gain enough entropy that eventually you are going to have to bleed off some heat through infra-red or into the soil though.

so short answer: big ass heat sink to compensate for lack of air.

==============================	
but how many lights there are?
the plot, from what i can remember, was basically that the dinosaurs had made it to the mainland (the first scene would involve a kid at a baseball game getting picked up by a pteranodon), and were wreaking havoc. ignoring a few obvious plot holes, like the fact that they could be stopped by the military, not to mention literally any food source that didn't have lycine, the plot ultimately turns a race to save mankind from extinction as dinosaurs run rampant all over the world. 
anyway, hammond, who is still alive i guess, institutes a contingency to kill the dinosaurs by way of a sort of virus that wipes them out, so, he sends a team to isla nublar to retrieve the whipped cream bottle that nedry stole. for some reason. they make it to the island, and then they are viciously attacked by "trapdoor raptors". velociraptors that come out of the ground and attack you. yeah.
then, one survivor gets the bottle, with the embryos, and uses them to create the monstrosities you see in the picture, and they become cops. dinosaur cops. that whole thing about the future of humankind being in jeopardy? that's not part of the plot anymore. at least i don't think.
i'm pretty sure that's not the story they're going with now, although it could probably work for a completely different project, and even then probably not really. you can find the article about the original draft on latino review, i think. the guy calls it the most "bugfuck insane thing i've ever read".

so here comes star wars. basically followed the same formula as all popular stories, the novice (luke), the princess (leia), and the rogue(han), hell obi wan kenobi appealed to older people as the wise veteran of war. you were guaranteed to relate to one of these characters. and then it depicted space as dirty, and by dirty i mean like pirates, space was the open sea and that is what makes the cantina scene so memorable. the millennium falcon was basically a flying pirate ship that was falling apart. this was drastically different to what space had been stylized before star wars.
i could go on but all these different elements allowed wide appeal. this is why it was so successful not only in the us but around the world, it had universal elements that everyone can relate to.
kind of reminded me of busta rymes when he played a white guy in one of his music videos. freaking uncanny.

smashing pumpkins have been my favorite band for 15 years, though i say that reluctantly now because i can't escape how big of an ass billy corgan is. there are tons of stories, from him being rude to fans, to him being a complete asshole to his bandmates (although to be fair, the other members had a lot of issues themselves). my personal story is from the zwan days. i went to a zwan concert, and very excitedly waited out by the tour bus afterwards, as many fans will do. when billy finally came out, he motioned for the small crowd to quiet down, and because they did not do so immediately (and i mean **immediately** - about 1 second), he turned away, got on the bus and that was it.  
except that she (and that accent) were one of the weaker points of *the prestige* and bill murray outshined her by far (in my opinion) in *lost in translation*. haven't seen match point, so i'll take your word for it.

i can't stand the urge for directors stuffing in the rise of christianity or especally in anything dealing with rome. or playing off the roman gods as blatantly false and the christian faith as obviously real. people in rome actually believed in their gods, and power in power exploited religion, like they do now.
probably a leftover from the hayes code, but was i thankful when they scrapped the christ storyline from the rome tv series.

practice the voice talking into an empty cup so that it gives it the artificial echo.  think about sean connery's accent.  this will train your ear to the voice.  then, assuming there is somewhat of a cavity in the mask you bought around the mouth, just adjust your pitch to make it sound like how you got it with the cup.

first verse, she's firmly in the solar system. in fact, she stayed on the moon. but then, second verse, she traced her way through the constellations. which means she either just flew in a funny pattern around the ecliptic (which would only make sense to someone standing on earth; from her pov, she's just making seemingly random course corrections), or she actually flew to all those different stars. even at the speed of light, that would take millennia. she may not feel the passage of time (einstein ftw) but train would be long dead before she even connected one constellation.

rather than stopping and attempting to defuse the situation, he continues humping this chick, moving around a few different rooms of the house and anointing the furniture. i like to imagine him nervously looking over at his girlfriend with a guilty expression in this part.

presumably without interrupting, the devastated girlfriend pulls out a camera and records the act, waiting until both of them climax. 

she's seen the whole ugly thing. and what's his best mate's advice? "say it wasn't you."

i don't think you can really compare *george* romero, wes craven or john carpenter to the likes of cannibal corpse. many horror movies have a protagonist and a sole survivor. cannibal corpse's lyrics have none of that. it's all gore and atrocity with zero mention of any positives or hope.

i would say that's an adequate defense of it. i hated that lyric until i learned what it meant. still not great though

i dare you to try to stop me.
i know more than a few black people who might beg to differ that these lyrics are the "way" they talk. besides, hardly even a majority of the lyrics i've seen in this thread are even from hip-hop, and most of *those* are of the party rap variety, which by and large is on lyrical life-support.

i live in arlington.  i have many good friends in manhattan.  the 9/11 attacks weren't an academic exercise for me, they struck my home, and my home away from home: and at some point, i truly find that the truther movement is very quick to undermine it's own credibility by embracing wild, massive, highly impractical conspiracy theories where, truly, none would have been needed.

what do i think happened on 9/11?  i think that americans, either under cheney, blackwater, or some subsidiary of both, went online and found a bunch of horny looser muslim kids on the internet.  they spent less than 100k total feeding these kids ideas and money, training them, and then they let them loose.  why? because, frankly, that's the cheapest, easiest, and most effective way to cause mass havoc on the scale of 9/11 period.  why bother to spend 1.5 million dollars for a cruise missile when you can do the exact same function for a few thousand in flight training lessons and airlines tickets for ignorant, superstitious/religious retards, of which there are plenty to choose from on the internets.

politics technology
==============================	

the thing i hate about the truther movement is the whole 'all-or-nothing' package about it.  either have have to believe that guys in caves did 9/11, or i have to believe that it was a massive conspiracy of thousands of fascist zombies pretended to fly airplanes in to buildings.   no.  sorry.  bullshit.  both of them.  the guys in caves didn't gain enough from 9/11 to make it worth their while, and complex, rube-goldberg-esque discussions of black operations, mystery missiles, and hundreds of pounds of 'secretly placed' hidden explosive are the shit of movies and over-active imaginations... not reality.

especially when, in reality, you can do the same shit with 20 loosers with airlines tickets and four airplanes, for a hell of a lot less cash.

the greatest lies always go down with a big dose of truth to make them palatable.  stop for a moment and ask yourself what's wrong with it actually being an airplane that hit the pentagon.  maybe the part of the story you should be questioning isn't the what of what happened (the shit that's difficult to fake- planes hitting buildings and all that that), and instead the who did it, and why.

twenty airline tickets and four ppl tickets together is a hell of a lot less expensive than even a single cruise missile.  we all agree that whoever made 9/11 happened did so for the bottom line...

why is it so hard to accept that official story of what happened on 9/11, which was in and of itself an ingenious, cheap, and simple way to cause mass carnage (assuming you have zero value for innocent life), and instead question who and why did it?

the spiraling costs of health-care are due to *unique* feature of the health-care market: namely, it does not follow the product life cycle that other markets do.

if you are diagnosed with cancer, and you are poor, would you be satisfied with the level and type of care that was available in the 1980's? of course not.

if you are poor, would you be willing to drive a car manufactured in the 1980's? of course you would.
politics technology
==============================	

in health-care only the most modern techniques are acceptable for *all* recipients - and the price is inelastic, because people are willing to pay whatever they can for good health.

so - the more unregulated (or "free" if you prefer) the market, the greater the pace of innovation; because production of goods and services in a unregulated market slant toward those who can most afford them, i.e. the wealthy.

one (the movie) is a work of fiction, is clearly a work of fiction, and does not urge its viewers to emulate the actions of its protagonist.

the other (the radio host) is not a work of fiction, and does specifically urge his listeners to take up arms against specific and named real individuals.

a movie about a president being assassinated is not a death threat (though it may be in bad taste).  a person saying "the president is an anti-american pro-terrorist crypto-muslim and we need shoot him!" is.  if you can't see the difference between the two i suggest you need to give your line of thinking a bit more analysis.

organic agriculture is expensive. how about you tell those immigrants making 10k a year that their loaf of bread is going up from $1 to $5.

these methods are at significant risk for catastrophic crop loss due to pests, or crop loss due to drought. remember the dust bowl in the 1920s? they also can take up significant pollutants from the soil, like pcbs or arsenic. 

they also require pesticides/herbicides and fertilizers that kill our watersheds.

you seem confused about my position. i support intelligent sustainable agriculture, not wasteful or misguided practices. we need to use  technology like gmos and modern genetic breeding in concert, develop management systems for waste, and support more self sufficient local markets. 

much of this is not in place but is in development. i have seen first hand the advances in genetic modification of plants using high through put screens for mutants and insertion of gene regions. i strongly believe the promise of these future strains will change the face of industrial agriculture. from one of waste to a more efficient system.

politics technology
==============================	
and no, i do not work for industrial agriculture or supporting industries.

&gt;organic agriculture is cheaper than industrial

not really. while some costs are externalized the real savings are produced from the tremendously large scale, and a well entrenched distribution and processing network.
politics technology
==============================	

&gt;claiming that organics require pesticides and herbicides, but are also at risk for crop loss due to things pesticides and herbicides fight.

organics require topicals, gm crops require less because they have some resistance already. organics are at higher risk because the effect is transient.  

politics technology
==============================	
&gt;gm crops don't have demonstrably better drought resistance than heirloom crops bred for the same purpose. 
&gt;gm crops don't take up fewer pollutants from the soil.

genetic modification is a tool, not a product. simply because something does not exist today commercially, does not mean that it cannot be created. i cited examples that are on the horizon for gmos.

politics technology
==============================	
if you had glanced at the literature i posted you could see that genes have been implicated in drought resistance and it is only a matter of time before they are exploited, through breeding and/or transgenics. 
there are also many mutants that currently exist in labs that take up less toxins from the soil. 

&gt;highly recommend you read the omnivore's dilemma

politics movies
==============================	
read it, i agree that we, as a species need to develop a equilibrium with nature. i prefer sustainable and local agriculture to the organic craze because it better represents what we should be striving for, using both technology and the natural ecosystem to our advantage.

&gt;claiming risk is miniscule because it's never been studied is never a good plan.

the simple biology of it lends itself to low risk. they are taking known proteins that we have been eating for millenia and putting them in different species. the toxic impact of current gm crops has not been proven in any of the studies done. future gm crops will be made using similar methods, that is, made current proteins more hearty, or simply making a currently non-toxic protein transgenic. while it is certainly possible to create a toxic gm crop, it is to no ones advantage. 
politics technology
==============================	


funny you are writing a paper on transgenic crops, because i studied them too. a lot. rigorous testing by those corporations doesn't mean much to the average person, because we are well aware of how companies skew statistics and internal testings the way they see fit. that isn't a conspiracy theory, that is fact. since you are writing a paper right now, i will assume you are in college. you are young. and like all college students (us too back in the day), you believe you understand the world better than anyone. i am not a conspiracy theorist, and if you believe anyone who distrusts giant corporations is a conspiracy theorist, then you are going to isolate yourself pretty badly in this world. there has been no testing by "outside" sources, for example the fda to prove if gm crops are safe or unsafe. imagine that monsanto invested millions and millions of dollars into their seeds, and their tests reveal that they cause cancer, do you think they will stop selling their seeds? probably not. they would skew the results so the fda would approve them. 
now, i find your article to be quite interesting. but again, that is only a small sample of the world. my whole basis for this argument is that gm crops are untested and unknown. there is no way to know if they are healthy or unhealthy. if you like eatting unnatural foods that have been created in a lab, then good on you. but me, i don't.

i am aware of the controversy surrounding the deaths from l-tryptophan and at least from my perspective have viewed as an issue of contamination. i personally think that genetic engineering simply got scapegoated due to it being a relatively new technology at the time. in the scientific community it has largely been debunked as not the fault of the engineered bacteria.

as long as there is any insurance, there will never be a free market. if a docotr wants to charge 100 dollars per visit, but insurance says no, we will pay on 50, that is not a free market. a free market means no insurance company setting costs and the doctor charging what ever he things he is worth.

actually, this is incorrect.  while it won't stop anybody who wants to steal a password, it's a strong enough deterrent to stop people who don't want to steal the password, but don't have the judgement to stop themselves from doing so given the opportunity.

programming politics
==============================	
a very large percentage of crimes and generic bad judgement are things that a person was presented with or came across easily.  the same argument (if they want to do it they'll find away around) is used on other things, like regular door locks.   while those security methods do not decrease the percentage odds of success, they significantly decrease the number of attacks (which would have been 100% successful)  

a good example of this is your household door lock, which is 100% breakable but works as a solid deterrent against all kinds of casual thief.    another would be "suicide barriers" on bridges.

adding a single (beatable, but relatively obscure) layer of security will stop casual password thieves, which will prevent at least some people getting their password stolen, but won't stop people from recovering their password if they need it.

in which case, he is part of the problem. according the wall's cult, people don't exist on a continuum: either you're going to heaven if you believe and live your life according to everything they preach, and you're definitely going to hell if you're gay. there is no middle ground. why do they deserve the respect and benefit of the doubt they refuse to give anyone else? they don't deserve it at all! they forfeit their right to that when they claim to preach the word of god about love, and do just the opposite. 

[paul haggis](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright) finally had the decency to leave scientology because they refused to renounce their endorsement of proposition 8. he wrote, and i agree: "**silence is consent, tommy. i refuse to consent.**" if paul haggis was so brainwashed it took him years to figure that out, then so is larry wall. will you now defend scientology's position and right to respect?
programming politics
==============================	

how is larry wall's cult any less hateful than scientology? just because the ancient myths and flat out lies they use to justify treating gays as less than human are more "christian" don't mean they're less hateful. they even went to the trouble of publishing a clarification that leaves no room for doubt, so larry wall has no room to claim that he believes in his cult's dogma, but doesn't hate gays, because that would be contradictory. he constantly brings up the subject of his religion in public, so the ball's in his court to denounce his cult's hateful beliefs, or else consent to it by his silence on that matter.

so now you're pulling ridiculous apologetics out of your ass for larry wall and his cult, which is even **worse** than silence: you're making up lame excuses why you think it might be ok for him tow the anti-gay agenda. not wanting to start a family tiff is no justification, when gay kids are committing suicide because of christian bullying. as long as we're wildly speculating: maybe he doesn't want to start a family tiff, because he wants to inherit his father's money. 

programming politics
==============================	
you're trying to justify a christian cult's hatred and larry wall's consent of hatred, therefore **you** are part of the problem too, because your stepping up to the plate and speaking out to defend and justify hatred is **much worse** than consenting to hatred by silence.

now in minecraft many random numbers are "seeded" to make sure that a certain call sequence always gives the same sequence of random numbers. 

for example in the world generator the seed is calculated from the position in the world (the 'chunk position') and a "world-seed". this way the world generator can create the exact same world from the same world-seed without the necessity to store and calculate the whole world in the beginning.

but this only works if you are careful how to create and use those random generators and because of this most methods which deal with random values are called with a random generator as an argument.

ah, but the natural world has no use for product clycles and release dates. it's driven by pure darwinism. i would argue a perceived "cludge" in the natural world only appears so because it it not fully understood.  remember, humans are not economicly rewarded for redundancies (they increase cost) but the natural world has no such economic construct in which to confine it. under this paradigm redundancy is embraced as an advantage which is why humans have two kidneys (for example). under an economic model that would be considered waste! i mean look at the extra weight and energy needed to bear such a burden? but somehow this has been deemed evolutionarily useful dispute the "costs" associated with such an inefficiency

one of the biggest reasons for having a professional engineer certification is to do with liability in case something goes wrong.  so, if you are in a field where a fuckup is unlikely to kill people, there is no need for having a pe certification.  another strike against it in the computer industry, is that the technology is evolving so quickly it is hard to say what is "good practice" right now.  just to give you a for example, chip designers are starting to adopt practices like unit testing and automated regression testing from software engineering to improve reliability.  software people often think hardware guys are some kind of geniuses because they produce such reliable hardware.  if only they knew that the hardware guys also think the software guys are some kind of geniuses because they get so much done so quickly with so few engineers :-)

thinking or calling someone else a sinner is a sin in christianity. remove the log from your own eye before pointing out the splinter in your brothers and all that. also, judgement is left up to god. 

programming movies
==============================	
nb, i am a atheist, but the above beliefs are a core tenet that most christians get wrong. the early church fathers wrote extensively about this, because arguing over who is more saved than who, or who is more of a sinner than someone else, was felt to lead to pride ( i'm obviously more saved than he is! ) which was felt to be a deadly sin, or tear churches apart in recrimination. or they worried that feeling you were saved would lead to a backsliding on the path to salvation, a false sense of safety, and a lack of spiritual progress.

so by even uttering it from his lips, larry is showing a big flaw. besides, there might be a alcoholic out there, who while in one way is more of a sinner than larry, may also carry out good works that shadow anything he has ever done. 

basically "don't judge a book by its cover", "judge not, lest ye be judged (god will judge you on how you treat others)", "remove the log from your own eye before complaining about the speck in your brothers (we're all broken in different  ways )"
programming politics
==============================	

protestant groups tend to be a lot more into "we're saved we are better than you". catholics/ orthodox tend to be "we're all broken in different ways", and this shows up even in stories about the saints, who were never perfect people. 
the teachings vary by church too, which makes it even more confusing. most christians then don't even believe in the specific tents of their church!

on the database that i worked on, this example search would have been implemented using our substring index. and possibly an equality index. here's how it worked:

the database maintains an index of all 3-letter substrings of the field in question. so, a word like 'apple' would have an entry for app, ppl, and ple.

when a 'like' query comes in, we would query the index for the index rows which match the query, find the intersection, then do additional processing using the equality index to find the result.

#1, google is an advertising *platform*. they don't create ads. they're just the platform that delivers the ad content. when's the last time clear channel communciations (billboards) gave away freebies to highlight their service?

*advertisters* give away freebies. that's why you can get lots of pepsi swag or activision swag when you go to conventions - they're the ones who have a product to sell, and they give out relatively inexpensive freebies as an advertisement (if someone buys a $50 blizzard game, that easily pays for the $5 it cost to print a tshirt).

wrong on two counts. 1. with this example, do you think it makes sense to say, "if google releases 1000 free phones to regular users in the wild, this will really expand the android userbase and thus attract developers"

developers attract users. that's why palm/hp's webos is a *complete* non-entity these days. it's a highly competitive platform, and a lot of people love and swear by it over ios and android. but there are no developers for it, thus no apps for it, thus no users for it.
the idea that anyone who uses windows and sql server are less technically astute is silly.  there are a great number of good reasons for using microsoft's platform, some of which are in the control of development/technical staff at a company, and some of which are ultimately not.

as is so often pointed out here:  correlation does not imply causation.  the fact that a lot of people doing interesting work are not targeting windows does not by itself imply that interesting work can not be done (or is not being done) using windows.  

oftentimes in academia and in the startup world, microsoft is avoided because of cost.  that is far from the only reason, but it is certainly the predominant reason.  if you're working on a project that involves multi-server scalability or very large amounts of data, and you are an academic or a startup without incredible funding, buying 30 copies of windows server 2008 and 10 copies of sql server data center edition is not feasible.  often in spite of the discounts and programs to help n these situations.  on cost, you can't beat free.

[matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matrix_(mathematics\)) on wikipedia for the basics, and then read [this](http://www.fastgraph.com/makegames/3drotation/) for how you use them in game graphics.

in simple terms: a matrix is a bag of numbers that describe a transformation in 3 dimensional space. this includes position, rotation and scale. you can then translate 3d points in space with that transformation, instead of doing it all by hand using sin and cos.

i could for example have a vector (0,0) pointing at (1,0). if i want to rotate it, i have to calculate the direction and length of the vector, change the direction and then move that point back again. with matrices, i just take the matrix of the object, multiply it with a rotation matrix and i don't have to worry what the previous result was, it just works.

even a linear picture suggests we're closer than 48 years. your data points do as well; it suggests doubling every two years or faster. price halved from 2006-&gt;2008, and price nearly halved and snps doubled in 2008-&gt;2010. 

it's possible the technology 23&amp;me is pursuing fits their objectives of selling analysis, rather than working towards full genome sequencing. how would they test for snps they don't know exist, and what would they say? i assume they plan to take it up when it's more profitable than their existing system and no sooner, and other companies will eventually carry the torch to their doorstep. the greater challenge by far is medical research keeping up with the pace of data.

&gt; actually the reason for introducing radians is as follows. the length of the circumference of a unit circle (a circle of radius 1) is exactly 2 * pi. that means that the length of the circumference is exactly equal to the number of radians in a full circle. do we gain any advantage by this knowledge? no, but mathematicians think it is cool.

seriously?  okay, here's what we gain from knowing this.  if your circle's radius is 1, the length of the arc described by an angle and the angle's size in radians *are exactly the same thing*.  this is useful if you need to convert radius and change in angle per unit time into velocity, to pick just one of the many things a game programmer might use this information for.

**edit**
programming sports
==============================	

of course, if you measure angles using an eight-bit system and discard anything over 255, you're going to run into some interesting other problems if you try to calculate velocity from an angle.
neither of those. calculations can be automated.

math is human made abstractions, symbols simply try to describe those abstractions.

yes. i don't think schools more advanced than that really use silly mnemonics like "soh cah toa". [wikipedia at least indicates that trig is usually taught in middle schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trig).

not aiming for portability when it's not the goal of your project doesn't make someone less competent.

again, i'll agree, microsoft has done a lot of damage to the industry as a whole (particularly in the past.)   but, again, that has nothing to do with the competence of those who choose to use their technology.

unfortunately, "notable" *as actually practiced on wikipedia* does not in any way resemble this -- more often it's a stand-in for "i don't like this topic" or, more insidiously, "i want to increase my edit count".

what about hurd? it does have some fans, but is it *notable*? i know that the creator of hurd is richard stallman, which also made the gnu os and toolchain, but i wouldn't include it in an encyclopedia until it's something that is solid, stable, mature or, *at least*, complete.

i don't want to turn this into a flamewar about what is notable or not. it probably does no harm to have hurd as an article, but it *is* true that wikipedia is being prolifered with all sorts of niche oses/kernels and things that have no relevance to an encyclopedia.

i suppose my opinion could be elaborated or expanded. i think gnu hurd has it's place in an encyclopedia because it is a part of the history of the gnu project, and explains the effort that was undertaken to have a gnu kernel.

i really don't think nemerle meets wikipedia's notability guidelines.

if you want to claim that those guidelines should be overturned, that's all and good, but that's a seperate debate that should take place outside of the afd page.
those deletionists really start to piss me off. people invest work to create an article about some topic and those fuckers delete it because they think it's not "notable" enough for their glorious egos. 

programming politics

wikipedias amount of articles isn't limited by space. while it's necessary for paper-based encyclopedias to limit the number or articles, this simply isn't the case for a web-site. 

if people fear that there is "information overload", the solution is simple: tag articles, remove references or put them in a "less noticable" category. but idiots like this stupid monsanto fuck aren't simply able to grasp the difference between a paper based medium and a computer based one. and because of their stupidity they kill the work of lots of people. and for what? for nothing besides their fucking egos.

programming politics
==============================	

my point was that implying that wikipedia is something lesser than a real encyclopedia because of controversy over articles that a real encyclopedia wouldn't even consider including is ridiculous.

wikipedia is something greater than an ordinary encyclopedia in large part because they *can* include articles like this and they do everyone a disservice by refusing to do so.  as someone else pointed out here, anything of greater relevance than a personal page should be kept.  it costs nothing and the idea of "clutter" on wikipedia is silly.  no one is thumbing through pages here.  people get to articles by searching and clicking on related links.  even if an article were irrelevant to most people, it's unlikely that the uninterested majority would ever even see it.

well, i won't judge what's important to other people; i'm sure there's a sociologist *somewhere* cursing every wikipedia deletion of a pokemon article because he/she was working on a thesis about video game obsession or the like. i *still* don't see why deleting things outside your purview really matter; i mean, let's delete the prescheme article, because it doesn't add anything you can't find in the linked articles, and it's a niche subject at best.

i wonder if we could use this info to turn into a replica of you…
information is measured not just by quantity, but by quality. google has shown us this. finding what you want is valuable. this includes not finding stuff that isn't useful to an extent.

here's a parallel. if i want to find out the information about each of the weapons in dead space 2 or ratchet and clank: size matters, why isn't this on wikipedia? answer, because it's too esoteric. that doesn't mean the information shouldn't be somewhere. and it is in many places, on other sites or wikis. and a simple search will find this information for me. so there's no overriding info for it to be on wikipedia.

wikipedia is not what you think it is.
there are other rules too, so the 'asdfkljaslkfjdaklsjdfkl' article still wouldn't work.
modification, not removal of the notability criteria is ideal.  the ability to use other sources to establish notability would be good.  imagine if your "asdfkljaslkfjdaklsjdfkl" site was launched last week but was already getting more traffic than the #1 site of all time, but nothing had been published about it yet.  it's not notable according to wikipedia.

so long as it has *something* of note, i don't see the issue. i agree that personal projects shouldn't be on wikipedia until they have *some* level of adoption that makes them interesting; just like we don't necessarily need a wikipedia entry for every minor star wars character, we probably don't need an article per cms system. still, i think there should be more of an "expert run" atmosphere (although that has many problems too!); wtf do i know about ibises, turtles, languages spoken by 10 or fewer people or anything else outside my purview? 

programming politics
==============================	

you only need to do that once though (or use a library that does it), and after that matrices can handle most things.

it's always good to understand the underlying trig though. for one thing, like the article said, it's very natural to store at the least part of the base rotation using angles. a common form for things like player characters is using hpr (heading, pitch, and roll) angles to store rotation.

programming technology
==============================	
there are other useful techniques. quaternions are indispensable for blending or averaging two or more rotations together. there's really no way to cleanly average two rotation matrices and get a valid resulting rotation matrices, but quaternions handle the task perfectly. both quaternions and euler angles (a generalized form of the more specific hpr angles) are also much more efficient for transmitting rotations over a network, evan after including position.

quick graphs: [dividing by 2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=maximum%28%7cx%7c%2c%7cy%7c%29+%2b+minimum%28%7cx%7c%2c+%7cy%7c%29+%2f+2+%3d+1) vs [dividing by 4](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=maximum\(|x|,|y|\)+%2b+minimum\(|x|,+|y|\)+/+4+=+1). i'd probably go with 1/2 as you say.

of course factor is notable! i'm pretty sure most programmers have at least heard of factor.
but pokemon is a massively successful media franchise that includes many best-selling games. the user in question isn't deleting articles because he thinks they're "trivial", but because he thinks they're "non-notable". even if you think pokemon is "trivial", it's hard to deny that it's a notable subject.

this works on wikipedia as it is now, no? although it's fun to play this game, it should be obvious that i'm not saying that there should be false, slanderous, &amp;c. types of information on wikipedia, but things that are backed by research, backed by domain expertise, and have *some* level of user adoption, historic weight and/or various other weights (depending on field, it might be centrality to the field itself, extension of new research, &amp;c.).

it is, which is why i just went through (with my account which has a longer edit history than his, lest anyone suspect me of being some random n00b who showed up to make trouble) all his afds and voted to keep, because this sort of random deletion spree isn't constructive and never really accomplishes anything. better to give these articles some attention and see how/whether they can be improved than to just spam "delete, nn" over and over.
heh. experts... they often get mobbed away by people who don't know anything about the topic. my brother observed such a case where *the* expert of a particular voting system (the inventor himself) got so annoyed by some wikipedia contributor (who didn't even understood the math behind it) that he just left. he just couldn't be arsed to fix the damage over and over again.

being an expert doesn't mean anything. same goes for being right. the one who's more stubborn always wins.

cs &amp; pl theory is a *huge* subject; yes, he's worked in some *very* interesting sub-areas, but i still wouldn't say he would know enough about every niche to say "yeah, that's notable!" sure, this can become problematic; the peer-review process is a nightmare. however, i still think it would help more than people who have high-level views of an area looking into sub-topics.

==============================	

wikipedia is most certainly not a republic. 2000 year old political systems have no place in a modern collaborative encyclopedia.

that said, the modal discussion about notability does typically end up  requiring dead trees these days. this is something that may need to be corrected at some point.
instead of /whining/ about the decisions other people make about what is placed on the website they run,  why not run your own and see how successful you are?  wikipedia is kind enough to use licensing liberal enough to get you started fast.  they'll even give you copies of articles which were previously deleted for notability reasons, though you have to ask.
programming politics
==============================	

personally i think this entitlement mentality is disgusting. of course you think that the particular subjects you're interested are special and notable.  but thats a pretty selfish outlook.    yes, wikipedia isn't paper.  but there are real non-trivial costs related to keeping articles around,  not the least of which is the fact that it takes considerable effort to keep them free of outright nonsense, especially when there is a shortage of regular editors with significant experience in the subject area. there also is an apparently infinite supply of spammers interested in benefiting from the "trustworthyness" (sad, but joe blow considers wikipedia pretty trustworthy) and search engine juice of wikipedia.  it might be clear you _you_ that you and your friends aren't spammers,  but that isn't clear to anyone else especially with your high and mighty entitled complaints.

and really— at the end of the day it's not healthy for the internet if wikipedia is the only source for good information on all subjects.  it's good that there are other places and things that wikipedia does not cover in infinite depth. this way, when wikipedia's policy inevitably gets something wrong we will all suffer less for it.

silly it may be, but it works. 
programming politics
==============================	

&gt; (i'm not sure i agree with wikipedia that non-notable articles should be deleted. it seems wasteful to undo the efforts of contributors, when disk space usage doesn't seem to be an issue. i would rather see a relevancy ranking attached to articles; this might sound contrary to the idea of an encyclopedia, but wikipedia already differentiates "feature" and "good" articles from others, so i would probably prefer that article son niche topics are labeled as such, rather than deleted.)

this makes it doubly painful; now one has to look elsewhere (fragmenting the search) *and* it doesn't have much of a point (save for the deletion of spam &amp; the like). 
it's of course just a theory. there could be a different motif behind his destructive sandcastle-kicking behavior.

laugh all you want, but i make good money cleaning up after idiots like this.
programming technology
==============================	
i suspect a lot of the issues with managing it people, technical people, scientific people, or any sort of educated, intelligent people is that they are generally straight shooters. i say this is true especially in it.

i am a software developer and i have always been a straight shooter. i don't play office politics. i don't care about internal power struggles in the company. i just want to design and develop software to be proud of with minimum interference. collaborating with peers is one thing, but having technology-illiterate management (aka phbs) get in the way infuriates me and i usually tell them why they are complete idiots. i always back up my decisions the best i can to prove it isn't simply an ego thing.

i can do the occasional dog-and-pony show and put on a good face when dealing with clients, but i have no patience for meddling micro-managers. the best manager is the one who hires the most competent people they can find and stay out of the way and run interference from outside forces.
programming politics
==============================	

if micro-managing is involved, then the project will go to crap. either the it staff is half-assed or the manager is trying to make himself look involved and important to the detriment of his staff. either way, micro-management is a very bad sign.
&gt;he hasn't consulted the opinions of others on this matter and thus acted alone for which there is no excuse.

this is pretty much the philosophy of wikipedia. the problem isn't what he's done, the problem is what others haven't done.

yes, i'm too late and it's frustrating ..... i want my programing wtfs!
&gt; the question is how you decide who has "a more refined domain knowledge".

well, you get subject matter experts, peer review, and votes &amp; and a hole bunch of problems. it's a messy issue, and certainly non-trivial. i've worked in physics publishing on the peer review side; that stuff get's nasty, and i'm not even taking into account my *own* experiences with getting work published. i *do* think that if you're not contributing to the article, you're not contributing to the domain that the article is in, it shouldn't really be terribly important that it be deleted (other than in the case of spam, violation of law, or other category). yes this means you'll get all sorts of absolutely low-brow trivial garbage; it also means you'll have a higher propensity for gathering &amp; fostering domain experts.

programming politics
==============================	

i guess that's unfortunate for a free encyclopedia that doesn't enforce you to have accounts before commenting (and some sort of pseudonymous reputation system).

&gt; who decides that they're an expert or a non-expert?

programming technology
==============================	
certainly not me; i don't work in .net, and i may have only a slight work area the coincides with nemerle (in types &amp; macros). from my perspective, i don't see the issue for deleting nemerle, other than wikipedia policy.

&gt; i can pretend to be a programmer who's never heard of nemerle, or i can pretend to be a programmer who uses it every day.

well, you could fix this by some sort of reputation system if you were really interested in weeding out totally trivial articles. or you could just not care if there is a community of people using a system that's not spam, not breaking the law &amp; not raising any other issues.

2) for those in australia, less added to bandwidth caps

wikipedia should implement a policy that does not allow for moderators to motion for deletion. furthermore, more than two moderators should have to weigh in to delete an article with a majority "keep" vote. at least, that way, majority opinion would matter _somewhat_.

what do you think of these ideas? perhaps a general discussion of wikipedia policy might help, too.

&gt; i really hate deletionists.

i can guarantee there's at least one article you'd gladly delete. it might not exist right now, but there is *something* that even you think is too moronic, too 'inside', too downright dull to merit inclusion.

so, the issue isn't whether you're a deletionist, it's where you draw the line at deleting something.

how do you get a full list of the flagged pages? right now i'm just going to save a copy of the pages (yay for google cache) in case i'm ever curious and want to look them up. i usually reserve doing this for really interesting things i find on the web, but this seems like a good exception to make.

to quote the person in question, "assume good faith." i'm not out to vilify him; i disagree with him. i don't think it matters really, if he is a multi-phd holder with 10 years of experience hand-coding type systems up from the ground; if he's not working in the area, not submitting new information to nemerle (or whatever sub-niche you pick) and isn't part of the community, i don't think we should take him as a real expert in notability. i agree with all the other points you make, but i think those are ancillary to my point.
