i think the issue often lies with the journalism rather than the study. science articles these days seem to extrapolate and exaggerate the actual contents of the journal, e.g: kepler 22b.
no problem. only took less than a minute of dragging and dropping.

i just realized that i never said what i wanted to say in the first place when i replied to your comment.  
i am so sorry about the loss of your daughter.  you speak of her so lovingly and i am so sorry you lost her. 
one of my missed pregnancies came back with t18 in the path report and one of the ectopic embryos came back with a host of missing chromosomes (don't remember what).  the re gave me this news each time like i should have been relieved, but relief was never really the emotion i felt when she gave me this news.  
you are an amazing and strong person.  i congratulate you on your success in trying again and wish you the absolute best in the impending birth of your child!

i know a defilippi from peru, his name is bruno.
i think the people who named these also used to name bbs's back in the 90's.
its family is common shrew opossom.  there are other species.  this is a new species in that family.

sad, but probable, knowing humans...
they're like the asians of monkeys
sorry, i've got to know. well, curious anyway what did someone reply here with that was bad enough to get removed?
this is so cool!
i am almost willing to not be disappointed if no tentacles wave in front of the camera.
is there an article to go along with this or something? only five pictures and i'm pretty sure one of them is just trees :/
i just wanted to provide an instance of contradiction, but positively. i was serious, btw.

oh, i assure you, i have many.
looks like that snub nosed monkey may be extinct again. 
i'm peruvian. this makes me happy.
cold fusion [works fine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muon-catalyzed_fusion); it just happens to be even *less* efficient than hot fusion. so we don't pour money into it anymore, even though there were some recent breakthroughs that might make it somewhat more efficient.
here's the thing: the big laser described in the article is the tip of the iceberg w.r.t. fusion research. the big deal is [iter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter), and progress at iter has been steady and successful; it is expected to reach first plasma -- *with net power* -- sometime this decade. there's an absolutely huge amount of plasma physics research that has gone into the design and development of iter, and if it weren't going to work we'd've heard about it by now.
there's also the navy's long-shot, secretive [polywell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polywell) fusion project, based on the ideas of the tesla-esque robert bussard. if it works, it could produce fusion energy within the next decade -- but the idea has been less scrutinized by the scientific community and it's still kinda up in the air. the good thing is that it's much cheaper than most fusion research; the bad thing is that, for whatever reason, they don't publish anything about what they're doing. the most recent status report is "everything's going along fine".
i wonder how this will affect models for the formation of galaxies or when galaxies collide or maybe where the mysterious cosmic radiation comes from?

hi. people have been making some claims on dark matter, so here's something i wrote a week or so again in response to the same article being posted:
no. this is incorrect. as the article states:
&gt;scientists suspect it is composed mainly of hydrogen, with some oxygen and other elements
these are all atoms that interact with light(hell, that's how they found them in the first place), something that dark matter doesn't do. period.
the "issue" the article talks about is missing baryonic matter. baryonic matter consists of protons and neutrons, and other subatomic particles, just like you and me. the issue being is that there's a whole lot of it that's unaccounted for, about 1/2 of all you &amp; me like matter in the universe.
you might now be asking, how did they discover this issue? simple, theory. the theories currently used in cosmology for the evolution of the universe predict a whole lot more of baryonic matter, and we simply couldn't find it, even looking back at the oldest galaxies. now, we've found it, in the halos of every single galaxy in the universe.
there is one more thing to note here: dark matter is thought to be comprised of only a **little bit** of the stuff we see in the halo of our galaxy. that means that the 40 billion(ish) solar masses worth of gas surrounding our galaxy currently is only chump change compared to the rest of the dark matter surrounding us.
the article is misleading, i think, and i can see where it gets you confused. let's look at one more point to nail us home.
our milky way revolves around its' central black hole extremely fast. *too fast*, in fact. it was estimated that for our current rotational speed to be feasible, the matter surrounding our milky way would have to be at least a factor of 20 higher than the normal matter in the galaxy. if you read the article mentioned above, the highest estimate for the amount of normal matter in the halo is 60 billion solar masses. the milky ways mass is 200-400 billion stars.[source](http://www.solstation.com/x-objects/darkhalo.htm)
other than that source, i did this all by memory, or by the article above.
hope this helped.
yea, that makes you seem less crazy.
it galaxies are surrounded by a halo at millions of degrees, how is that reconciled with the temperature determined from the microwave background?
i'm incredibly jealous of these awesome discoverers, solely because of their talent for dropping sweet adjectives a la night monkey and enigmatic porcupine.

sorry for hulu, looks like this episode is not on pbs.org any longer. 
not really. these regions are extremely inhospitable for a variety of reasons. and, some biologists would argue that the smaller species are *easier* to find than the larger ones. the larger tend to be much more enigmatic and prone to not getting caught in project nets and the like.
the authors were smart to sequence it and place it in a phylogenetic tree. too much waste in serotyping, and then ignoring a wierd result. good for them, and thanks.
you read your table wrong, it's ununtrium.  the 'ri' probably looks like an 'n'

hi there,

no, you can use the quote to show predicting technology is hard.  that goes for government funded fusion programs or solar energy projects (solyndra) too.  the government is no better than anyone else at picking winners, they just have more money to spend.
there are in fact several promising fusion approaches that are *not* big lasers or tokamaks, but the government settled on those two, instead of funding all the ideas.  
wtf are they pulling that monkeys hair
the night monkey is very charismatic looking.

it is not like there are guerillas that will kidnap your rich ass for ransom... oh, wait.
the atomic number of uut, ununtrium, is 113. the atomic weight is 284. 
i was talking about the atomic weight, the atomic number is in the title of the post so i felt it unnecessary to restate.
i probably should have noted it, especially since i had thallium's atomic number there instead of it's weight.
yeah, i came here to say, that monkey made me take a 'fraidy pee. 
it appears obsessive. and when you constantly use quotes it appears even worse. then you saying you have other obsessions makes me feel like you do this a lot. what is the definition of insanity?
ah, you're right.  it's small text, i misread it.  double checked it up close and you're right.
that's pretty much exactly what he said. small species are found fairly often, finding new large ones is really incredible.
i figured it was either that or you were genuinely asking. my apologies for not understanding your joke. have an upvote.
i wonder what makes that porcupine so enigmatic.  it's a mystery to me!
i think that's just a placeholder until they figure out why his quills are so long, then he'll become the well understood and entirely uninteresting porcupine.
as a fellow peruvian i am very happy to hear about this.
so, they discovered a new element and that's it?  they are just going to move on to another one.
"element 113, ununtrium?  been there, done that.  old news."
really?  is this what i'm getting from the post?
i'm being a little facetious, but i'm also being serious.  is this just how it works?
if i seemed abrasive, i sincerely apologize. 
i wanted to see a little bit more on element 113. i realize that it was probably very unstable. anyone could just say they created element 113.
&gt;it appears obsessive.
well that's your problem. other people don't have a problem with it.
&gt;and when you constantly use quotes it appears even worse.
using quotes allows me to split up your post into the separate arguments that make it up and address them individually. 
&gt;then you saying you have other obsessions makes me feel like you do this a lot.
"obsession" is a way of saying "interest" when you want to be negative about it. transhumanism and immortality is one of my interests. another is science. another is technology. another is freedom...
people who have a bad grasp of reality and are scared of death.
not at all, and i've edited the post to be more clear.
they had science back then too.  underdeveloped, and often misguided.  but they were asking how and why.  religion is what happens when you hold on to a hypothesis too strongly.
i can't imagine how complicated controlling a fleet of aircraft flying like this would end up being. currently jets just kinda cut right through the wind by flying in a straight line or a predictable curve, this makes it a lot "easier" for air traffic controllers to avoid mid air collisions.
karma.
am i getting this right? 
there is a vast halo surrounding the galaxy, massing at about what the galaxy itself weighs, and heated to a hundred times the surface of the sun. 
how exactly is this maintained and how is it so damn hot?
god damn stop being creepy.
 i feel like earth just got a new update and we are getting new mobs.
they claim its the only second new species discovered in 28 years.... the top science reddit right now is about 8 new species found in peru.
maybe they found 8 more right afterwards..?

i personally find that fact that you want me, along with everyone else, to die to be rather creepy.
that was my issue with this when i saw it earlier this week. couldn't find the original study so i have no idea if it's addressed there, but it seems like the terms of attractiveness are skewed heavily towards contemporary, western standards of beauty. it's such a subjective and culturally-relative factor that i don't see how this could ever apply to anyone that isn't a 21st century western woman.

a "reliable rater" may exist but tastes differ by quite a bit. suppose the the 2 guys in the study are chubby chasers? or are partial to blondes? maybe they don't like flat asian faces, or curly hair or big butts. 
[lili langtry](http://i.imgur.com/s4lgd.jpg) became a sensation internationally because of her fabulous beauty but she wouldn't be considered all that by today's standards. [norma talmadge](http://i.imgur.com/dnvza.jpg) was known as the most beautiful of the 3 beautiful talmadge sisters, all stars of the silent era. not sure how a reliable rater would put her on a scale of 1 to 10. 
[clara bow](http://i.imgur.com/gfbgq.jpg) was the famous "it" girl of the roaring twenties; "it" being sex appeal. how would she rate on that today?
beauty is not always a quantifiable quality to be reliably rated.
what's creepy about death? it's already happened to pretty much everybody.
just because people want to live forever doesn't mean we should. 
that's not racist. 
what's the difference between a 'discovery' and a 'creation' of these elements? don't they all have to be created?

this is true. prior to treatment for endometriosis i was a 34b, today (4 years later) i am a size 34d. 
thank you! 
is the article claiming some sort of objective standard, or is this more of a "by current social standards?" 
i understand that aesthetic evaluations are subjective, and can hinge on many different aspects of the subject being asked. but none of this is a critique of the methodology. it's a criticism of a type of claim someone might make from this sort of data. did they make the sort of claim that you are responded to? 
can someone explain the reason behind something like 113 not occuring naturally?
and these elements that must be created in a lab, is there any possibility of them being held stable, even if the technology does not yet exist?
or are they just simple lab tricks that don't have much usefulness.
care to elaborate?
i think you may have misread that. they actually said that it was the second type of african monkey found.
thank you so much. it is a terrible disorder. i feel very blessed that i got to meet my daughter at all. so many people don't get that chance. i have read a lot about it, and i truly wonder if endometrious could be a factor. from what i read, it happens when danage is caused to the egg. some of what i read said it happens when the egg is formed, other just say damage happens at some point. 
i am sorry for your losses. thank you so much for your kind responce. i wish you all the best :)

the "gas" is ultra-thin (probably a few atoms per cubic meter), and so a ship crossing it wouldn't really absorb dangerous ammounts of heat.

illegal gold mines are bad, but even worse is the illegal loggers that chop trees without replanting them somewhere.
i'm far from an expert, but nothing above (with a higher atomic mass then) plutonium occurs naturally in nature. this has two major causes, the primary one that their half lives are too short, for example the next element above plutonium, americium, has a half-life of at most 7370y. the second being that every element above iron needs to be formed in a supernova.
the really heavy elements being "held stable" would depend on their half-lives. as far as i know, there's no way to prevent radioactive decay.

&gt;it's already happened to pretty much everybody.
that has little bearing on how creepy it is. hell, it just makes it a little more creepy.
&gt;just because people want to live forever doesn't mean we should.
[i recommend you read this, it's about why we should cure death.](http://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html)
he was saying that this amount was expected on the baryonic front. the matter that we know of in the universe is only about 4% of total matter in the universe. 
when saying the non baryonic matter is much more massive, he means the total amount of it expected in galaxies. 
japan has all of those too...
it depends entirely on whether or not dark matter plays a large role in how the gas is distributed. if it clumps together into relatively(in comparison to the total size it *could* take up*) small areas, then it won't be an issue. however, if the gases are similarly spaced out to what the early universe was(a year or so after the bb) then it'll be an issue, considering the large amounts of thermal energy we'd eventually collect.
also, i don't think inter-galactic travel is something we really need to be considering at this point. we're hardly out the solar system with our farthest probe, and we have literally no ambitions as a world to go there right now.
japan may have some dunes, but no actual desert.

no worries, i have. the only thing they couldn't test for was endo.
i doubt that graphene will replace silicon. the physical properties are too different to allow a simple transition. silicene is a better candidate there, it can be implemented without much friction. graphene sure has its uses, but less as mere substitute for silicon than as basis for completely new applications.
yeah, it always astounds me that with all the money and resources thrown at largely phantom threats like terrorism, we barely put any effort into asteroid detection and ways to divert them (there is *some* progress being made, but too slow in my opinion).

i'm fine with this as long as they don't create [element 115.](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/element_115)
it felt wrong to label this "insightful" but what the hell...
taco bell?
the 'discovery' in some sense would come before the element is made, by proving via modelling that that particular element (and isotope) is theoretically stable. 
but then the act of creating it is also a second mode of discovery.
alright since you seem to be in the know, i'm assuming the particles of this halo are all pretty far apart, so you couldn't actually stick a thermometer anywhere and measure 2.5 million kelvin, and you could fly a spaceship through it without problem. or is it actually a practical barrier?

the problem is that people actually took the question seriously and saw this as ng officially disproving evolution.
/r/heroworship
read through the paper. the algorithm is extremely simple. it seems like the two points to retain are
1. the algorithm is parallelizable which is what distinguishes it from previously known algorithms. that said, how much is gained through that is not clear from the algorithm alone. i was a little concerned about efficiency; the parallel version runs the risk of performing a same computation more than once as opposed to the sequential version (i.e. pruning in one iteration does not spread to other iterations). experiments seem to show that, for practical purposes, the gains of parallelization greatly outweigh the losses. i'm certain nonetheless that one can come up with graphs in which the sequential version greatly outperforms the concurrent version.
2. the heuristic method is fast and experiments show it to be rather accurate. the authors do not give an approximation ratio however. without it, there's no guarantee it won't be especially bad on particular graphs so i'm not sure this will find many adopters.

&gt; the theories currently used in cosmology for the evolution of the universe predict a whole lot more of baryonic matter, and we simply couldn't find it, even looking back at the oldest galaxies. now, we've found it, in the halos of every single galaxy in the universe.
right, nucleogenic theories based off of the cmb and early galactic evolution. this can only explain baryonic evolution.
&gt;there is one more thing to note here: dark matter is thought to be comprised of only a little bit of the stuff we see in the halo of our galaxy. that means that the 40 billion(ish) solar masses worth of gas surrounding our galaxy currently is only chump change compared to the rest of the dark matter surrounding us.
 
this is not based on those same nucleogenic theories, only gravitational data correct? 
at first i thought that this gas may in fact change the energy density and volume profile of milky way sufficiently enough that it would produce a lot of results. 
anyways, i attempted an energy density calculation, but that was nonsensical, there was nothing really to compare, the rest mass dominated everything. i tried to compute velocities but they were to low or to high. must have been using a wrong stellar density formula( even tho i used the wiki one). anyways, i just made an momentum calculation, not sure why i didn't think about using an average velocity sooner so i could get an easy comparison between the predicted vs the observed. here is [the momentum of the milky way galaxy + gas cloud with predicted average speed](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282*60e9*%283%2f2%29*6.2e13*2.5e6%2b+%281250e9*1.6e5*1%2f%281-%281.6e5%2f3e8%29%5e2%29%5e%281%2f2%29%29%5e2%29%5e%281%2f2%29). and here is [the momentum with the predicted average speed](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281250e9*1.6e5%29*+1%2f%281-%281.6e5%2f3e8%29%5e2%29%5e%281%2f2%29+). finally, here is the [momentum of the milky way with the actually observed average speed](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281250e9*2.5e5%29*+1%2f%281-%282.5e5%2f3e8%29%5e2%29%5e%281%2f2%29+).
when i derived the momentum for the milky way in terms of the theoretical speed + gas, i used the average kinetic energy for a gas and then solve for p^2 . then i calculated the average relativistic angular momentum per radius for the mass of the milky way + the mass of the gas and then the rest is pretty much explanatory.
 so with the gas, the milky way comes to .035% closer to its observed value with the new gas. 
which obviously shows that the gas does not account for anything substantial.
it must be. not unless there is some sort of intergalactic flow. 
i believe that, i got fired from my first job at a pool 4 years ago, it was my first time guarding and i was scared of messing up because of the vat's. i didn't really talk about that job after that, til a couple months ago a guy said he wanted to work there for the summer. i told him its a cool pool, i know the manager, said her name, jolt went down my spine just by saying it. that night i had a prettt intense dream of a little girl drowing while i was guarding, and everyone just gave me dirty looks and i woke up. just figure maybe saying her name immediate brought that rush of fear and guilt of failure back to my senses. so hearing about this is interesting. 
how can you jump to that conclusion if you cannot derive it from nucleogenesis?

if you ever look at the clear night sky through nvgs, you will see that not only is the night sky *not* dark, but it is more beautiful than you ever thought it was before.
it's probably something similar as to why the sun's corona (atmosphere) is so hot even though it is very far away from the sun.  
which means we would have no idea why it is so hot.

when that kelp (or any other photosynthetic organism) dies, its biomass is *usually* ingested or decomposed, either way eventually ending up as co2 back in the atmosphere via respiration. only when plant biomass is buried quickly in an anoxic environment does carbon get completely removed from cycling in the atmosphere/oceans (that's how petroleum formed, and it took millions upon millions of years to accomplish), and this only happens in special circumstances.
sure, more kelp biomass will mean slightly less co2 loose in the environment, but it will only amount to a drop in the bucket. what we really need to avert a climate catastrophe is an efficient way to move carbon out of the atmosphere/oceans and into the ground, and keep it there. 
you left out the fact that it doesn't really matter if they figure out what one it is because there is no treatment for any of them. 
hi. there is currently a semi-accepted theory on why this occurs. 
back in late june, a solar tornado(we'll call them sts from now on.) was discovered on the surface of the sun. it was about the size of continental europe. 
what they believe happens is this: the sts are caused by magnetic fields on the suns surface. they cause hot hydrogen to on the surface to form these sts, and after a certain point in its life time, the magnetic field snaps back to its original position. this causes all sorts of friction within the tornado, which causes thermal energy to be exchanged. the most energetic particles escape out, into the corona, giving it its' distinctly high heat.

what you must understand is that the entire surface area of the milky way is vast, and that the hot gases that on "on top" or "under" the milky way are all extremely far apart(in comparison to their size). there's no collection of gas in the halo that could rival even the smallest nebula. 
i'm not sure of the dispersal of the gases in the halo, but i'm sure if you were to try to specifically collect a lot of the gas,(assuming it's the average density of hydrogen in the universe, which is less than 1 hydrogen atom per meter^2) you could manage it and test the heat yourself.
it doesn't form a practical barrier or "wall". it's like the [oort cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oort_cloud) except it's not so hypothetical anymore. it's sparse, but still there. 
hope this helped.
difference being this is an atom, not a particle. that, and scientists have been trying to create 113 for years.
that snub nosed monkey is fucking terrifying. 
can someone please explain the significance of this? since it's highly unstable, we're not going to have any practical uses for it. is it just that we learn more about the characteristics of elements? was it even around long enough to get any scientific information? 
yeah, that one should've been called the smug monkey. 
i was just thinking about this.  there are multiple theories about how the brain handles memory and personality.  if memory is holographic or, as you noted, has plenty of redundancies, then regrowing lost brain tissue won't be as big a threat to one's 'self'.
so, you're in favor of melting ice? 
you all are right about that.  assuming civilization keeps on keeping on, our kids' kids' kids will look back on the tech of today like we do that of the dark ages.  there really is no telling what is to come.
no, most theories account for a different *type* of dark matter, such as hot, cold, or lukewarm. the structure of dark matter atoms(which there might or might not be, i don't know) is still undefined. 
the amount of matter that this new discovery provides for every galactic system doesn't correlate to the amount of matter needed for gravitational lensing in any type of galaxy, large or small.
also, in my first post in this, i gave a statistic for why all the baryonic matter that is possible in our halo doesn't provide the pressure needed to keep the milky way intact.
excuse my ignorance. now, does this mean that they have evolved or that they have only been discovered recently?
&gt; as opposed to looking for non-specific cancers? that makes no sense at all.
it's about looking at general morbidity and mortality. for example, just because tests prove that fluoride doesn't cause herpes doesn't mean that it's safe. clearly fluoride can cause other things than herpes, so you can't conclude it's safe by eliminating one of a thousand different possibilities.
&gt; they're the factual side of the debate, supported by numerous scientific studies.
yet i'm the factual one in this debate. ask any of my friends.
i saw the pictures of the ones discovered in 2009, and [oh god why](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/098/cache/giant-armadillo-peru_9828_600x450.jpg).
i certainly don't mourn its passing. 
[i've seen some shit](http://i.pbase.com/o6/23/786923/1/93984611.khvtvrkm.img_2280.jpg)
this seems interesting, mainly because i have a thing for thermodynamics and its connection to information theory.
i can say right now that you can demonstrate (relatively) clear, trivial applications of the point they're making.  for example, consider a flywheel.  there, you can easily extract most of the kinetic energy from it as mechanical work: just plug in some other rotary mechanism that will use that energy (plus some gearing), and you're golden.
in contrast, imagine a form of that flywheel, made of the same molecules, with the same aggregate molecular speed distribution -- but instead of being highly organized into a particular shape, the molecules are just scattered around disorderly, perhaps as a gas.  in that case, you can extract a far smaller fraction of the energy in a useful form (i.e. as mechanical work) -- you basically have to use it as nothing more than a heat source, and so are limited to the carnot efficiency 1-tl/th, where tl is the temperature of the environment and th is the apparent temperature of the gaseous "flywheel".
what is the difference between the two scenarios?  well, one way to put it is that you have a better model of how the flywheel works (that is, you know the path all its molecules trace out, as they're confined to being on some rotating point on the flywheel), which allows you to better extract the kinetic energy.  lacking such information for the "gaseous" flywheel, you can't extract nearly as much of its energy in the form of mechanical work.
the authors appear to generalize this concept:
&gt;the remaining nonpredictive information reflects model complexity that does not improve predictive power, and thus represents the ineffectiveness of the model. we expose the fundamental equivalence between this model inefficiency and thermodynamic inefficiency, measured by the energy dissipated during the interaction between system and environment.
that is, the better your model of the phenomenon (higher model efficiency), the more energy you can extract (thermodynamic efficiency).
note the surprising implication: if you could model the motion of a gas's molecules as well as you can model the motion of a flywheel's molecules, it follows that you could (barring only difficulties in constructing the apparatus) extract the energy from the gas with the same efficiency you'd get it if were a flywheel!
the way you'd do it is to operate a [maxwell's demon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maxwell%27s_demon) type setup, where you separate the gas into two chambers, and only open a little door between them when a fast molecule is going into side a, or a slow one into side b.  this then creates a pressure gradient from which you can extract work.  of course, the laws of thermodynamics are such that (for various reasons) you create at least as much entropy in *finding* when to open the door, as you would destroy in separating the gasses by high/low pressure.
note: this doesn't stop you from using a maxwell's demon setup as a means to *store* energy you obtained some other way.
what was that statistic? i provided a calculation in responding showing that halo cannot keep us in tact. as i said i was under then impression that the article said that the gas was equivalent in mass to the milky way galaxy. actually, i am still waiting for a reply for the post.
no clue what we were thinking when we downloaded it.
i so fuckin hope we discover extraterrestrial life in my lifetime. 
this does not surprise me at all, nor do i take it to mean we start to favor supernatural explanations as we age.
the current older set grew up in a time with less science education.  it is therefore no shock at all that this older group is more likely to feel this way.  poll the current set of youngsters when they get older and i bet they will retain the current percentages that you see now.
before i type my response, this is the definition of nucleogenic.
nucleogenic: the branch of physics that deals with the internal structure of atomic nuclei.(i don't know how you fit that word into the things i mentioned, but w/e)
now, on to what you've posted:
&gt;right, ~~nucleogenic~~ theories based off of the cmb and early galactic evolution. this can only explain baryonic evolution.
i'm simply talking about how the baryonic matter came to be though of as missing. also, since it's only baryonic matter we're talking about, it's pretty convenient that it helps explain baryonic evolution, no? nothing here is implied about dark matter, or where it came from. none of what i said tried to explain how/why dark matter is where it is. 
&gt;this is not based on those same ~~nucleogenic~~ theories, only gravitation data correct?
it is not.
&gt;volume profile
literally never heard that word before in astrophysics, but i assume you mean the total volume of the milky way &amp; it's halo?(both dark matter and baryonic matter.)
i'm going to be honest, math isn't my strong point, and i'll be even more honest, it seems like you're just spitting out math(with no sources as to where you got the information you did.) to prove a point. 
so, on with what you've said:(ignoring the equations, they didn't even make sense, since i couldn't find sources for any of the equations.)
&gt;so with the gas, the milky way comes to .035% closer to its observed value with the new gas.
this proves my point, you realize this, right? if we take the articles statistics about the mass of the halo as fact, then we most definitely need to have dark matter in our models. 
please clarify what sources you used for your momentum equations, or link me to a paper that has them.
hope this helped.
you lost me.
responded, went to play some halo, not gonna lie.
also:
&gt;i was under then impression that the article said that the gas was equivalent in mass to the milky way galaxy. 
this is not true. the speculated mass of the milky way is somewhere in the neighborhood of 200-400b solar masses. the statistic provided in the article claims at the highest, 60b sm. i used a middle range between 20-60b, which was 40b
there isn't much money put into making new short-lived atoms, mostly because their instability makes it impossible to study them for more than a couple seconds or even milliseconds. 
very interesting to see these new monkey species being discovered after not finding a new species for 20 odd years.

what i just read: we will never be able to leave the galaxy without getting cooked to crisp...
does it bother you that in the next few hundred years the sea levels might rise 40 feet?
aside from this being an extremely difficult accomplishment, what is the scientific value of creating element 113? does it provide new experimental data about our models of the atomic nucleus? is it stable enough to have any interesting chemical properties, or is it the kind of thing that has a half life of an eighth of a second?
stories like this make me pray we develop nano-techonology with the ability to destroy viruses and bacteria faster than said viruses and bacteria can mutate.
pic?
hence why its still just a theory and hypothesis instead of accepted knowledge.
i was more arguing against the guy saying it could not have happened. its still "possible" it could have happened, they just need more research and funding to explore the idea. 
i think mexico has them as well.
it's more important seeing as this is the first time a non-western nation discovered, and therefore gets to name, an element
if you had asked a chemist in 1824 what the newly identified element silicon was for, you might have gotten a bunch of shrugs. no one could have possibly foreseen that this element would become the cornerstone of our modern technological world 100+ years later.
many scientific discoveries have long lag times until practical application, but that shouldn't discourage us. if anything it should excite us to know that many of the purely academic things we discover today will eventually become ubiquitous tomorrow.
i wonder how many adults reading this article are thinking "yes, i can see how this applies to many adults -- but not me because i don't believe in *x*."
so would it be fair to say that these elements can be found naturally, but that as a practical matter they can't be found in our environment?
i enjoyed the first 2 episodes but the last one was a little bit distorted, i have no love for religion either but he seemed bent on using whatever argument he could for disproving god.  
i did find the section about the mass and energy of the universe to equal out very, very intriguing. 
no homers.
what would happen if the lakes were set on fire? could it be done?
good on you. we should never be afraid to say, "yes what i do is important, and i'm very clever but sometimes a task sucks. this is the easier way."
guerrillas are restricted to certain areas. the unexplored parts in the jungle are pretty safe. safe from humans that is.
jman5 hit it on the head, but i'd like to add one more thing.  by and large, the job of research scientists is just that, research.  they're the bunch that probes and prods and explores the world.
figuring out what can be done with something is the purview of engineers and inventors.  they look at the research and think, "y'know, if i just x and y, i could probably make some really cool z.  i'm gonna try that."
also, and i apologize if this comes off as mere pedantry, nothing is "for" anything.  at least not in terms of good science.  
example: water and carbon are both vital for life as we know it.  yet water and carbon both predate life by billions of years and exist in absolutely colossal scads all throughout the universe without being part of any living organism.  so while life requires water and carbon, you can't claim that either of them is "for" life without bringing an intelligent designer into the picture.  
&gt;can someone explain the reason behind something like 113 not occuring naturally?
i'm going to keep this as simple as possible : heavy elements like plutonium are, well, heavy. that makes them rather unstable : atoms are held together by [strong forces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strong_interaction), which keeps nucleons (protons and neutrons) together. however, that strong force only acts on short distances (*i don't really remember the exact distance*). in an element as big as 113 (113 protons, 165 neutrons), the nucleons on the outside of the atom aren't affected as much by this force. they're the first to get radiated away. this makes the atom more stable, and nature just loves stability.
&gt;and these elements that must be created in a lab, is there any possibility of them being held stable, even if the technology does not yet exist?
as i said, the heavier atoms will almost always be unstable and decay. some physicists have suggested that there could be an 'island of stability', where you'd get atoms which are more stable. see [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/island_of_stability.svg/800px-island_of_stability.svg.png): the darket the bar (atom), the more stable it is. however, according to this graph, there would be no perfectly stable atom in this island, and they would probably decay with beta+/- decay
&gt;or are they just simple lab tricks that don't have much usefulness.
it drives our understanding of atoms and science further.
hey, helena bonham carter
if a massive body impacted, it is by definition an extra terrestrial one.
no points for effort, sparky.
no because that's an outright lie.  why don't you go look up actual sea level rise rates.  they're rising at a leisurely 30-40cm per century....and they were already rising naturally.
do please research the progress fusion research has made over 50 years and what the calculated time frame of its completion is (spoiler, its about another 50 years). then think how much money it would need to completed in any reasonable time frame (yes, way too much). that's why it is still 50 years away.

element 113 and other heavy elements do not occur naturally because they decay too fast. the reason they decay quickly has to do with the stability of the nucleus.
i'm going to glaze over a large amount of material here, but in general you can think of this as larger nuclei have more energy than smaller nuclei and would want to release some of it to be more at rest, like how water flows downhill. what determines if a nuclei will not decay is the binding energy of the nucleus. [here](http://physics.bu.edu/cc104/nuc_stability.gif) is a graph showing the binding energy per nucleon as a function of the atomic mass number. adapting the water example, the binding energy in the nucleus can be thought of a glass tray holding the water in. the higher the binding energy per nucleon, the higher the walls of the tray are above the water level.
so, as you can see in the chart, the binding energy/nucleon peaks and then drops off for larger values of a. the higher the mass gets, the less stable the elements become. you can think of this as filling our water tray while making the tray bigger, but the water is filled at twice the speed the tray's size is increased. to add to this, the water inside the tray is sloshing about so it becomes much more likely the water will spill outside of the tray. this is sort of like how nucleons (protons and neutrons) behave inside a nucleus, they don't sit still.
from there it is easy to see that there is a value of the mass where the binding energy (walls of the tray) is lower than the energy threshold for radioactive decay (water level+sloshing) more often than not, so the nucleus decays very rapidly. and since there have been almost no events since the big bang that would create more of those really heavy elements like 113, it is a fair thing to say there is none left in nature.

thanks elbowgreez, it didn't come off as pedantry at all i'm honestly ignorant on that subject, well a little less ignorant now thanks to you and jman5. i wish i could study on this field but i'd have no idea where to start and it's pretty daunting.

russia is western?
i think i found a copy of the paper [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~evansem/coexistence-legare-et-al.pdf).
the future is clear enough to know that you need to come up with fourty times the sea level rise.  look, you cannot warm the oceans fast enough to do that...their thermal mass is just too high...and you're not going to see the greenland ice sheet collapse within 100 years.  it would require it melting something like 200x the current rate.
i'm sorry but the only way this is going to happen is if something other than climate change does it...like a supervolcano or meteor...and then co2 will be the least of your worries.
if this were true you'd expect to see some variation between specific age groups in industrialized nations and non-industrialized nations to a measurable extent, but from what i gathered from the paper that is not the case.
you can argue no, but the world is usually decided east vs. west, so in this context russia is western. 
did you read the article? the *interesting* part is that it appears people are more likely to adopt supernatural explanations to some degree or another as they age.

not the case at all, but let's worry about actually being able to travel at the speed of light(or faster) before we worry about it.
cheers.  i'm not sure exactly what field you're talking about, but if you're just looking to improve your basic scientific literacy, you can take some pretty simple steps.  if your background is, like mine, more towards the humanities/liberal arts side, you might want to start with some history and philosophy of science so that you get a good picture of how the scientific method works, what science's place in society is, how that place has changed and will continue to change over time, etc.
if you get a kick out of all that and enjoy thinking critically, i'm sure you'll find something more specific to dig into.
oh, and surround yourself with people who either work in or are studying science.  plenty of them enjoy breaking things down for the under-initiated.  besides, just as many will probably be pleasantly surprised that a layperson is taking an interest in what they're doing.
of course, if you're thinking about studying particle physics, i agree; that shit is daunting as fuck.

yeah, my data set has some outliers.
only assholes go to zoos.
now it seems to work (again).
at first that was my position as well. upon further review of the results, both strings gave similar data sets. therefore i adjusted my search pattern.
&gt;before i type my response, this is the definition of nucleogenic.
nucleogenic: the branch of physics that deals with the internal structure of atomic nuclei.(i don't know how you fit that word into the things i mentioned, but w/e)
**nucleogenesis**: the origin of chemical elements in the universe.
 +**suffix: -ic** :  used to form adjectives from nouns with the meaning "of or pertaining to";
=**nucleogen-ic** : of or pertaining to nucleogenesis.
i hope that helped.
&gt;now, on to what you've posted:
*"right, nucleogenic theories based off of the cmb and early galactic evolution. this can only explain baryonic evolution."*
&gt;i'm simply talking about how the baryonic matter came to be though of as missing. also, since it's only baryonic matter we're talking about, it's pretty convenient that it helps explain baryonic evolution, no? 
i was simply stating such to make sure we were on the same page. 
&gt;**nothing here is implied about dark matter**
see, i don't get it when you say things like that, but also say
&gt;there is one more thing to note here: dark matter is thought to be comprised of only a little bit of the stuff we see in the halo of our galaxy. 
if dark matter is only a little bit of the stuff that we see in our halo then this is making a direct ontological commitment that dark matter is a.) simultaneously two things *(as opposed to one thing only)* b.) part non-baryonic c.) part baryonic.
or this:
&gt;these are all atoms that interact with light(hell, that's how they found them in the first place), something that dark matter doesn't do. period.
yet another ontological commitment. you are committing yourself to the truth that dark matter is non-baryonic and as such there is no other evidence besides observational data.
&gt;literally never heard that word before in astrophysics, but i assume you mean the total volume of the milky way &amp; it's halo?(both dark matter and baryonic matter.)
not at all. i do not mean total volume, i mean the profile of the volume. it is quite one thing, the way some one pictures the milky way galaxy, and it is quite another to analytically describe the **shape** or **profile** of the **volume** with which one wishes to integrate over. to integrate over the stellar or nucleon density function one needs a volume profile, or shape, to integrate over. so, as one might expect, when one introduces something like 10% more extremely hot volatile matter in a region of interest, one's brain must immediately start think about profile of the volume you are integrating over and how it would effect the aforementioned integration.
&gt;i'm going to be honest, math isn't my strong point, and i'll be even more honest, it seems like you're just spitting out math(with no sources as to where you got the information you did.) to prove a point.
actually, my only intention was set out to prove that which was true because i had found no enlightenment in this subreddit. i had no point, i was simply curious to find the truth no matter what i may have thought before. the reason i presented my rough calculations was just in case if some one else was curious and wanted to talk about it.
&gt;this proves my point, you realize this, right? if we take the articles statistics about the mass of the halo as fact, then we most definitely need to have dark matter in our models.
how is one either right or wrong if one misreads something? are they not just mistaken? i think quite fare of me to argue that the language used in the article is quite ambiguous and as such, in rereading it still seems to exactly say what i thought it said.
 anyways, if nasa *had* found a halo of gas with equivalent mass to the milky way galaxy, and if one obviously operates under the assumption of the copernican principle, then we could have potentially found twice the actual mass in the universe! even so there still might be a chance that they find more mass given the some one preliminary data.
yes - that's what i want to know too.  i can't imagine it's very dense gas, right?  why doesn't it just radiate that energy away?  also, why can't we see it if there's so much of it and it's so hot (rather, why are we just noticing it now)?

again, an ice sheet has to melt and that's just can't happen until long after co2 levels have begun to fall again.
spot on.
&gt;you might now be asking, how did they discover this issue? simple, theory. the theories currently used in cosmology for the evolution of the universe predict a whole lot more of baryonic matter, and we simply couldn't find it, even looking back at the oldest galaxies. now, we've found it, in the halos of every single galaxy in the universe.
this is not true. oops. if the gas is equivalent to less then 10 percent of the milk way's total mass then some mass is still missing. 
&gt;no reactor which requires 90 tons of liquid lithium can ever be a viable reactor, nor can reactors which costs billions be considered any sort of alternative power source.

i'm trying to learn back some basics at the moment and do classes on coursera.org to see if that project stands a chance so i don't end up chasing a dream. 
still at the stage where i'm trying to wrap my head around all the different fields and what they concretely entail so i know what i should aim for. physics, chemistry, genetics, biology, cosmology... so many interesting fields, all so complex, i shit my pants in terror and awe just thinking about it.
so if japan names element 113 we need to throw them a party and welcome them to the west?
if it at one point got the energy (from being part of a star for instance), it can't get rid of that energy other then to radiate. heat transfer is a matter to matter transfer of energy.
"empty space" is the best thermal insulator you can imagine, since there's no matter to conduct the energy, so any excess in energy needs to be radiated, which isn't all that fast as matter to matter transfers of energy.
people often imagine that they would instantly freeze if jettisoned into space, but since you can't get rid of the heat your body generates, you're more likely to boil in your own fluids.
still don't know what would kill you first though, exposure to the unfiltered sunlight or boiling yourself.

no, it's not. birth control is a means which has to be available when people need it, right. but most people in underdeveloped countries would not willingly use it. you must first produce a change in the mentality, otherwise birth control is useless. and that change in mentality is achieved by creating security for old age. read articles on the work of bill and melinda gates for charity, this discussion has been had a thousand times already.

how happy is that kid that his article is posted here? he's probably framed this page. 
but why do it if we get nothing out of it?
how would that be criticism? it's more like a compliment!
too right.  that said, in general, if i were in the business of predicting a single sub-reddit wherein i imagined that the old reddit values might still be applicable, /r/science would probably top the list.  
on a completely different note, having spent some time in eastern (that is to say "amazonian") peru, nothing about this article surprises me.  the eastern slope of the andes represents what i am pretty sure is one of the world's most remote and inaccessible regions.  anyone who has been there will know exactly what i mean.  it's kind of like mordor in that one does not simply walk into it.  there are no roads worth the name, and although there are trails, they are all poorly charted.  you can fly helicopters into parts of the region, but a lot of it is strictly vertical terrain which makes for dangerous canyon flying that's usually not worth the risk and that is often far outside of fuel-range regardless.  you can take a "peki-peki" upriver from the big amazonian towns like puerto maldonado or iquitos, but they can only get you so far and then you have to slog it out on foot, for weeks, as far as i can tell.  
back in the early 90s when i was a young vagabond, myself and some friends tried to get up into the tabaconas namballe region and failed.  while it's true that we were young and stupid and probably doing it wrong, the fact that we never did get back up in there does go to show that it's a hard place to get to.      
  
radiation is pretty crummy when it comes to heat transfer. also likely not that dense, just big.
actually, the united states has all of those as well. in fact, california alone has all of those if you count a temperate rainforest. 
and in case anyone was wondering, puerto rico has america's only tropical rainforest.
snub nosed monkey; wow.
you wouldn't actually boil because your body is sturdy enough to maintain internal fluid pressures. you would die of hypoxia pretty quick though.

so we're going to need a larger heat sink? 
could we worry about not cooking the earth to a crisp first? 
the more we know the smarter we are. even failed studies teach us things. 
at least *someone* was thinking ahead. 
yes, but that is only part of the equation no? even if dead, your body will still generate heat, while also not getting rid of the heat that was already present. don't know if it'll build up bad enough to actually boil your fluids, but it'll easily go over a lethal fever temperature.
which is what i meant before, not really boiling to death, but getting to the fever temperature that we know to be lethal (which isn't all that high, around 42¬∞c)
i'm aware of the true purpose of the us military, and you're absolutely right.
but that doesn't mean congress is frugal. they're not. they spend *way* too damn much money on useless superweapon research projects and other such nonsense. there is no non-doomsday military application of nuclear weapons, for instance, and doomsday isn't profitable.

whats with the potential "island of stability"?
does anyone feel it strange that the mayan calendar ends while the earth is in a stage where there are many close call meteors around, i mean we are supposedly going to see two of the closest meteors ever to pass earth within the next year or so. maybe this is what the mayans were talking about and how they started there calendar, after a huge meteor storm that destroyed great parts of the earth.
but i'm curious here; what would happen if we inject this into a human brain? would the subject have advanced communications with his/her cells?
umm what? black body radiation. radiation does not require nuclear processes, and in fact everything that's above absolute zero is essentially constantly radiating heat.
i found the impact area over 3 years ago.  i tried to go public but my cinematography skill are somewhat lacking, as are my credentials.  however every time a post regarding this 'impact' is asserted, i once again go on the offensive, trying to gain notoriety for my theories.
you can check out my video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwygy8tiini&amp;feature=plcp) if you are curious.  the more people that see it, the better my claim will be at being the discoverer of the craters, yes there are 2 of them.
if you want to lecture about the scientific method, you should remember that this issue of pnas had a pre-arranged editor.  publishing in sources with pre-arranged editors and short-circuiting the peer-review process sort of removes this from the direct line of "scientific method."
that's the other big thing about this supposed theory.  even if an impact occurred, the likelihood that it had anything to do with "wiping out populations" is ludicrous.
an impact large enough to cause major damage over millions of square miles would leave unambiguous evidence.

so if this "halo" matter exists and we didn't know about it.
and we think dark matter exists because (due to mass calculations) there must be some matter that was not known where it was located. so we invent a theory that it must be some sort of "dark" matter that we cannot see made of some never before seen subatomic particle.
then why can't this unaccounted for matter be "halo" not "dark"
there is nothing too cool it.
please don't ever comment on physics again.
and i just started my dissertation on carbon nanotubes as well.
thank you for the long reply, it was insightful.
dark matter is fundamentally different than baryonic matter. we know from observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb), which comes from a time before galaxies have formed, that there must have been a form of matter around that does not interact electromagnetically. or else the patterns we see in the cmb would look very different. basically, dark matter can collapse much more easily than hot gas, because it doesn't feel any pressure due to interactions of the particles. this influences the "clumpyness" of this particle soup that at some point became galaxies and stars, and that is what we can still observe.
not to mention that the amount of dark matter this observation implies matches what we know from other totally unrelated observations, such as the kinematics of clusters and galaxies.

because it contributes to our sum knowledge of the universe.
discounting the importance of an element because it only exists for seconds is like discounting quantum physics because everything is too small.
it's only by thinking outside of the normal frame of human observation that we are ever going to make new discoveries. just as centuries are nothing to the infinite existence of the universe, milliseconds can be forever when speaking in terms of nano-molecular chemistry.
these clumps you are talking about, those are galaxies and stars. i'm no engineer, but i think it's pretty safe to say that ~100 atoms per cubic meter won't be much of a problem, no matter their temperature.
you are consufing probability and predictability. conway's game of life is an example of a chaotic system, which are systems that are deterministic but unpredictable in their outcomes. there is *nothing* random about conway's game of life.
quote from english wiki:
&gt;"the "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that **its evolution is determined by its initial state**, requiring no further input. one interacts with the game of life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves."
&gt;the point of course is that while evolution is deterministic, its inputs are not, so replaying it over and over will have different results because the inputs vary randomly.
this does not even make sense unless you at first tell me what "evolution" is as a model. the point is that what we perceive as randomness might as well be deterministic, but we model it randomly because we are incapable of calculating the deterministic events that occur. proability theory is a tool that helps us grasp information that is generated by too much other information, rather than telling us what actually is random and what not (because there *is* true randomness in our universe as well, usually on the very micro scale - and why that can lead to deterministic systems is a very interesting question nobody has of yet found an ultimate answer to). 
&gt;mutation is random,
i don't know if it is. it might be, given that the scales that are involved are small enough, but we might just model it with probability because it's impossible to do so deterministically. i'll grant you that saying it is random is as good as it ever gets, so we can agree on that.
&gt;and random input to a deterministic system will result in random outcomes even though the process itself is not random but guided by environmental pressure and natural selection.
oh, i'd be careful with that one. i haven't thought about this in full, but if one year of formal mathematics have taught me anything, it's that you need to be careful with following your intution and common sense. i won't deny the correctness of the statement, i just won't say it's true as of yet. i'll need to think about that.
the problem we have here is what i wanted to make clear in my initial statement. evolution, as you see it, is not a model that has given input at a particular time and then simply evolves (haha). you see mutation as input, as would i, but this requires a system that gains new input over time, hence it must be dynamic and thereby not determined by its very first boundary conditions (but by the local ones, i.e. the ones *at any given point in time*).
to add to the trouble, mutation isn't the only "input" factor, and the number of input factors may change depending not only on time, but on geography, different occurences and trends that are usually occuring in an evolutionary system and even things that have occured in previous time-states might turn out to become input variables (like humans do on earth).
but in this respect, i believe we actually agree, at least what you wrote makes common sense and i never doubted it (if i gave the impression, i apologise). the mere thing i objected to is that evolution is *only* randomness. which i understood to mean that you believe it to be entirely open and "unguided" (which you too said isn't what you meant).
edit:
there are obvious counter-examples to your claim. consider a system s(x) with any input vector x. let the output of that system be constant, i.e. s(x) = c for all x. then randomized selection of input vectors will always grant you the same outcome.
it's a theorized group of elements where the "tray" more equally contains the water, therefore causing the elements to be more stable and therefore less prone to decay. not entirely sure about what causes it, though.
how on earth is it a compliment?
it will likely be named either nipponium or rikenium.  it seems as though "japonium" is not very well liked due to the fact that it sounds, "like a certain racial slur."
source: i attended a conference held by riken last friday.
ah, yes, the denier creed of pretending two things are equal.
so, if one loses 9 and the other gains one. do you end up with a positive number? no. the loss of ice in the arctic is far outpacing any gains in the antarctic. 
http://tamino.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/anom.jpg?w=500&amp;h=322
the pyromaniac in me says otherwise.
to be a bit more specific:
it's not that they don't occur naturally.  they do.  it's just that when they do occur, they decay so quickly that we do not have the chance to find them.
&gt;and since there have been almost no events since the big bang that would create more of those really heavy elements like 113, it is a fair thing to say there is none left in nature.
this is inaccurate.  type i and type ii supernovas are both capable of creating them.  and that doesn't even note the possibility of relativistic streams from black holes, or anything else that we have not yet discovered.
i'm italian and now i'm embarrassed that you are part of my nationality.
you are probably one of those loser ass guidos that have never been to italy and has no clue what being italian is really about. 
it's not as unstable as the stuff around it.  to make it simply, certain numbers of neutrons and certain numbers of protons are more stable.  (think like when an electron shell gets filled in an atom/molecule, only in this case it's protons and neutrons--a bit more complicated.)  the area around 118 is "less radioactive" than the surrounding areas.  meaning it has a half-life of a few seconds, and not of a few milliseconds.

how would you even use japonium in an insult anyway?
"man, i hate this building, i bet it's made of japonium."
"stop being such a japonium!"
"i want a japonium for my birthday"
this would prevent us from leaving the galaxy correct? also theoretically prevent anything from getting into the galaxy?
so, does this mean we have found all the possible stable elements that exist?
well that's a pretty cluster-fucked headline, stepped a bit when translating it on-the-fly to my father.
so, to manipulate (stored? not sure) qubits, there needs to be an entropy transference, which is accomplished with heath trasnference. and that means the qubits cool/heat one another to operate?
"jap" is a racial slur. think about naming an element found in nigeria niggerium, or something similar.

if you're a pyromaniac, then titan would be hell for you, it's cold, dark and nothing can be set on fire.
i don't think you understand how this works.
if you inject the emmiting cell, and then inject instructions to broadcast something, then it will.
not that it will "directly" affect neurones, since they don't have a nucleous   where you can insert more data.
i don't think there is anything wrong with this.  let's examine it.
&gt; in the new study, researchers looked at 100 women with rectovaginal endometriosis, 100 women with less severe endometriosis, and 100 women without endometriosis who were undergoing gynecologic surgery for other reasons. most of the women in the studies were in their late 20s or early 30s.
now using 4 raters is fine - if they don't know the diagnosis beforehand, their subjectivity will introduce only *random* noise, not a bias.  more raters would cut the noise, however.  
so 31 severe women (31% of 100) had the severe form.  that has a 4.6 1 sigma error (binomial stats).  hence that's a 95% confidence interval of 31% [22%,40.2%].
now the low-sigma group has, similar reasoning, a 2.86 one sigma error a 95% range of 9% [3.2,14.7].    that's a 4 sigma difference between the two!  ie  (31-9)/sqrt(2.86^2 +4.6^2 )=4.06
this is way stronger than the usual 2 sigma threshold for medical research.  it's hard to get 4 sigma by chance.
so i think this is pretty strong.  possible biases: age bias in samples, or attractive (rich?) people seek medical care more.  but i doubt it. 
it is a sad day for pyromaniac-kind. :(
thanks
no you don't.   4 raters introduce *random* noise. this would decrease the significance of the study, but not introduce a systematic bias. 
as long as the ratings of the groups are significantly different, they are measuring *something*, and that something is what they think is attractiveness.  even if they get attractiveness wrong compared to some larger population, then the study found *something* that's different in the groups.

'jap' may be an insult, but it's also the prefix to the name of the country an it's people, so that doesn't make any sense.
additionally, your africa comparison would have made more sense if you used the country niger.
right? i can't even make a zombie joke because this sucks so bad. to think i am witnessing a shift in human history for disease emergence is depressing. on a continent that desperately needs a unified leadership and vision - and isn't likely to see one in our lifetimes - potentially species-threatening events are occurring. 
i remember when bono visited bush in the white house and got him to dramatically increase the us contribution to aids funding for africa. wouldn't it be funny if he/they knew what we are just now rationalizing? 
&gt; what if both of the guys happen to consider a woman's legs as the most important feature in overall attractiveness? 
so what?  there is still a difference in the groups.  it's a sexy-legs difference, but its still a statistically significant difference.  that doesn't go away.
then why even include them on the table?
thank you.   the naysayers don't understand scientific studies.  there may be valid criticisms, but they sure as hell did not bring them up.  
it's like climate deniers picking away at climate science without understanding it.

while this would be lovely--there are several problems with this. mainly costs and distributions into remote areas where they are most prevalent.
also, pathogens comepte against each other in the environment and within hosts. this affects the virulence of a pathogen. a pathogen needs to be virulent enough to outcompete others without killing the host too quckly--otherwise it cannot replicate and spread. 
by getting rid of some virueses and bacteria, you are essentially altering their ecosystem which may lead to more virulent strains to develop. 
yes.
statistically, it's pretty damn probable that at least a little meteorite eroded to dust by the athmosphere, and at least one of its particles fell to the ground.
that particle (body) had mass (massive), came from outside our planet earth (extraterrestrial), and non-tangentially (impact) touched the ground (earth).
edit: it came from outer space, instead of having extraterresrial camouflage paint.

the base of mars' mount sharp - the rover's eventual science destination - is pictured in this august 27, 2012 nasa handout photo taken by the curiosity rover. the image is a portion of a larger image taken by curiosity's 100-millimeter mast camera on august 23. scientists enhanced the color to show the martian scene under the lighting conditions we have on earth, which helps in analyzing the terrain
this doesn't influence anything.   there is still *some* visual difference, called 'attractiveness as measured by n=4 people', that is statistically different among the groups.
it doesn't matter what n is; the difference is still statistically significant.    you can't concoct 4 sigma statistical significance out of thin air.  there has to be a real effect, or an underlying causal effect related to endometriosis (eg, victims tend to be white, and raters find whites unattractive).  
am i the only one here who doesnt care about these "new elements" if its not stable enough to hold in your hand shud it really count

hey, animal husbandry people around the world:
stop using antibiotics on animals at once. kill the animals instead. we are germinating superbugs with this crap.
and india is not helping by selling antibiotics otc.

i computed 4 sigma above  (9/100 vs 31/100). that's damned significant. 
thank you. for a second i thought i'd have to comment that myself. it's amazing how half the most up voted comments are about a species of monkey in burma when that has nothing to do with the ones in peru, as the op posted.
i can't access the article--can you perhaps it pm it to me? i want to go into epidemiology and this sounds really really fascinating!

scientists have already created atoms (albeit also short-lived) of elements 114, 115, and 116. if 113 stayed elusive, we'd have a hole in the periodic table and a lot of questions to answer.

that same picture of a microbe is in my biology book and its not actually of the salmonella virus 
this sounds like the opposite of a superbug, this seems like a disease that relies on someone having a terrible immune system to even exist. 
&gt;yea but we can't count things that we haven't confirmed exist.
i guarantee you that with all of the heavy nuclei jumping around in a supernova that at least some heavy nuclei will hit other heavy nuclei, resulting in at least some atoms of these exotic elements.  how much is created, and whether or not we could detect their creation through all of the other radiation, is a different story.
assuming we'd ever be able to travel to these distances in the future, does this mean we are essentially barricaded in my a hollowed out sphere surrounding our galaxy?
did they only make it so they could name it? that's what it seems like to me. also, odanium after their most stand up citizen : d.

the monkey is from india, not peru. also there are only roughly 300 individuals left of the species and they are considered critically endangered thanks to deforestation and hunting.

if you're referring to the snub nosed monkey it has nothing to do with peru. it's a monkey from india. the one in the picture held up by the two people is a gutted adult male.

not really, it's very much alike a superbug. the problem with superbugs is that they are the survivors of a weak/short use of antibiotics. the more antibiotics they survive the more they adapt to the antibiotics and become multiresistant in the end.
here we have something similar. the weak immune system can't fight off all of the salmonella, and the surviving salmonella are more resistant to immune responses. the weakened immune system still trains them for other stronger immune systems, by giving them time to adapt.
oddly reminiscent of the energy field surrounding the galaxy in star trek.

did they interview the same people 20 years ago to draw that conclusion? the article does not say. interviewing a 70 years old and a 20 years old in 2010 will obviously present different views. it does not mean that they become superstitious as they age, just that old people are more superstitious.

free abstract: "a remarkable feature of modern silicon electronics is its ability to remain physically invariant, almost indefinitely for practical purposes. although this characteristic is a hallmark of applications of integrated circuits that exist today, there might be opportunities for systems that offer the opposite behavior, such as implantable devices that function for medically useful time frames but then completely disappear via resorption by the body. we report a set of materials, manufacturing schemes, device components, and theoretical design tools for a silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (cmos) technology that has this type of transient behavior, together with integrated sensors, actuators, power supply systems, and wireless control strategies. an implantable transient device that acts as a programmable nonantibiotic bacteriocide provides a system-level example."

i came here to ask something similar: wouldn't a terrible immune system cancel out the ordinary evolutionary pressures on pathogens, weakening them?
you still should take them as a last resort rather then day one of having a sore throat.  need to address the problem at the root.  there are entirely too many people, pets, livestock, etc on antibiotics when they dont need to be.
you can't go to war with a continent full of such varying countries, and even so, what is it for? instead of "exterminating" the millions of people who are born there and live there, (some of which worked like slaves for mineral mines owned by white investors) how about we instead offer a helping hand to better our fellow human's lives? 
scientists are already making breakthroughs with finding cures for aids and donations of clothes, books, and other materials are always welcome. how about instead of complaining about a continent i assume you've never even lived in, why don't you make an effort to spread the word about the disparities in africa and take time to [donate to a good cause?](http://www.aidforafrica.org/donate/)
whoops, sorry!
i know the second part of your comment was sarcastic. not sure about the first, but there was a great ted talk about how improving living conditions in africa, for example, not having tribes have to survive on bush meat, would slow the development of new viruses and be a great investment on our (developed countries') part.

this is true, and a lot of this problem can be solved with information and preventative healthcare vs treat after symptoms appear. but who am i kidding, just go to the er if you're sick!
no problem. it happens :)

interesting paper about the salmonella but they are really trying to shoehorn in the hiv association.  (everyone who doesn't work in hiv tries to link their work to hiv so they can hit the hiv money pinata for funding)
anything that eliminates lithium from battery use is a good thing, you don't want to be using rare earths in somthing as common as batteries.

this is very true, but there is a difference between people personally misusing antibiotics (which is bad) and the farm industries just force-feeding mass amounts of antibiotics to livestock to protect the herd (which is pants-on-head levels of stupid).
india is not the only place where antibiotics are sold otc.  in fact, the usa is one of the few places where they are so restricted (and yet still overprescribed).

not if the people with terrible immune systems are also taking antibiotics.  very different evolutionary pressures.
i have a question about how they measure "temperature".  i understand temperature to be about the relative motion of atoms.  so in this gas cloud, atoms may indeed be zipping around very fast and thus a high "temperature".
but what is the actual energy density?  if you were floating around out there, would you actually feel "hot"? or are these high-energy particles still in a near vacuum and thus you would still be very very cold?
there very well may have been, but the only result given (in that article at least) was the average of all age groups across the board.  in the only direct quote from the study:
&gt;"if anything, in both industrialized and developing countries, supernatural explanations are frequently endorsed more often among adults than younger children."
it merely says that it occurs more often in adults than in children.  it could also be occurring more often between specific age groups or other countries in addition, but it does not appear as if that dimension was considered.
i do know it to be true from other reading that rates of superstitious belief vary greatly between countries, and that the youth across many industrialized nations is growing less religious, and less fundamentalist, with each generation.
good point.
i believe the idea is that because this large immunosupressed population isn't clearing the disease on their own (as most healthy people would after a few weeks), they're relying more heavily on antibiotics.  which allows more room for error in antibiotic useage, and potentially more evolved resistance.
i don't think this article is actually saying that it's happened, just sort of of vaguely worrying that it will.  which is, to be fair, a valid concern.
no problem, these things happen :)

this isn't the first evidence of hiv allowing for pathogens to evolve in immunosuppressed people...come on now.  there are many many opportunistic pathogens that are activated from latency, allowed to colonize, or expand in numbers upon immunosuppression.  all of this is known and they are evolving within these hosts...so the title is misleading this is not as novel as you think.
that's not true. we use information we have and combine that with ideas to form theory. but what science does is when something is not hold onto bad ideas, and is ok with being wrong.
okay, i can't really argue with that...

&gt; rechargeable batteries, like the one inside a smart phone, are usually made using lithium, which is a finite resource. the high demand and relatively limited supply means that lithium ion batteries are expensive, and the process to obtain it isn‚Äôt very good for the environment.
and this part is wrong as well. lithium is the 25th most common element in the earth's crust, and supplies are basically renewable since the lithium used in batteries is recyclable.

i can access only the abstract:
&gt; identifying causal networks is important for effective policy and management recommendations on climate, epidemiology, financial regulation, and much else. here, we introduce a method, based on nonlinear state space reconstruction, that can distinguish causality from correlation. it extends to nonseparable weakly connected dynamic systems (cases not covered by the current granger causality paradigm). the approach is illustrated both by simple models (where, in contrast to the real world, we know the underlying equations/relations and so can check the validity of our method) and by application to real ecological systems, including the controversial sardine-anchovy-temperature problem. 
&gt;the finding is the first evidence that hiv might be allowing new human pathogens to evolve in immunosuppressed people.
huh?!?! i think xdr-tb would have something to say about that. i use xdr-tb because its completely obvious but the list of pathogens that immunodef (with abs obviously) has helped become more virulent is ridiculously long.
since this is /r/science i am fully aware the immunodef actually slows pathogen evolution and that its the abs turning it into a chronic disorder and prolonged exposure to abs in general that is causing the evolution but i presume this is what the op was referring to.
well, at least no one was ever dumb enough to say that everything possible has already been invented.
i might just do it then. for science.
you take the internet way too seriously.

if people only took them when they have a bacterial infection then we wouldn't have a problem. if you have a sore throat its more than likely a viral infection not a bacterial one. your run of the mill throat infection is normally a secondary infection not a primary one. taking an anti-bio isn't going to do anything for you except make ab resistant gut microbiota and make more diseases like mrsa.
it would be helpful if gps were restricted to prescribing only when they have confirmation of bacterial infection.
if you don't care about the harnessing of new elements then read a science book or gtfo.
wrong.
can anybody eli5 some of the early applications we will be able to see the benefits of this from?
&gt;in fact, the usa is one of the few places where they are so restricted (and yet still overprescribed).
the us is restrictive? i think western europe would disagree.
no surprise.  inhabitat is a terrible source.  writers with no understanding of the subject tend to latch onto one understandable phrase or over-hyped promise in a paper.  they do no research or fact checking, but simply add a layer of obfuscation to a design or finding that has already been journalized by more reputable sources.
downvoted for gross inaccuracy.  sure, lithium (11th most abundant element in seawater) is 'finite', but we're not supply constrained nor is raw lithium a significant component of battery pricing.
that was the smuggest, douchiest edit of all time.
what the fuck has this got to do with the article? the article is about a compromised human immune system providing a "testing-bed" for a bug to develop human-to-human transmission. 
while misuse of antibiotics is a problem for sure, your post adds nothing but a diversion from discussing the implications of this study.

india is a vast and heterogeneous place. it is impossible for you to make a sweeping statement like this.
"table sugar was pyrolyzed under various conditions. carbons of pyrolyzed sugar demonstrated high capacity for li intercalation, exceeding that of graphite. experiments were carried out to search for optimal pyrolyzing conditions. the electrochemical behavior of these carbons was found to depend on the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, argon gas flow rate, and morphology of the precursors. pyrolysis of sugar was also carried out under vacuum, which is equivalent to a high argon gas flow. carbons of pyrolyzed sugar under optimal conditions showed large reversible capacity, ‚âà650 mah/g, small irreversible capacity, ‚©Ω170 mah/g, and small hysteresis between discharge and charge in carbon/li metal electrochemical test cells. pyrolyzed sugar carbons are therefore potential candidates as anode materials in li‚Äêion batteries.

actually... it's not that bad for breeding germs inside of you -- if you take the full course you're fine and are not breeding antibiotic resistance.
its the low dose antibiotic secreted in urine that allows tolerance to arise in bacteria (or when people don't take the full course)
hi there,
although a wonderfully written article, this review is not peer-reviewed. unfortunately it cannot be cleared for r/science because sciam is not a peer-reviewed journal. i would suggest r/neuro or r/softscience. sorry! 
i'd just add that anti-biotics are a misnomer. they don't cure bacterial infections they just aid the immune system. 
this is very important to remember in the case of somebody with aids because their immune system is effectively gone so often aids patients are given abs for extended periods of time just to keep them alive. this leads to ab resistant gut micro-biota which is what mrsa is. then when you get an actual pathogen their dose has to be increased dramatically and often cocktails are used. these abs often don't kill the infection which is the golden rule of abs. if you are going to use abs you have to be damn sure the immune system kills them all other wise you excrete ab resistant bacteria and they multiply and you get a resistant strain. this is why its vital to finish your course.
so with aids patients we give them abs knowing full well we are breaking the golden rule but we can't leave them die. 
basically it would be super great if people stopped getting aids because our one defense against them is not going to work for much longer and we don't really have much in the way of alternatives. we need more time.
one is darwinian evolution and one is all about activating preformed ab generators.

i have been thinking about this a lot lately. i would think that a system where governments do not have debt and do not collect taxes would make everyone happy. just have each country get one gdp per year to spend on whatever and call it good. the only reason the whole fucking world is struggling with debt and having to do less is because everyone agrees that is the case. if everyone agreed that there was no debt everything would be going swimmingly.
why is our species doing this to itself? 
i pretty much stopped reading when they referred to lithium as being finite, but said sodium was infinite.  lithium carbonate, which is its most commonly sold mineral form, costs less than $10 a pound.
i see so many things get posted to reddit that purport to be 'scientific' studies that 'prove' something or other, and then i look at the actual methodology and it's fucking laughable, even to a non-scientist like me.
people don't understand statistics, and yet they go on to make claims like this one.
so there is nothing we can do but hope our body's own natural defenses will hold in a futuristic plagueland..? 
the support you are getting is unprecedented.
your mother loves my neck beard, thanks. 
wrong, a theory is a proven hypothesis.  you are referring to the common usage of theory, or simply a scientific hypothesis.
like a vaccination against humans! 
unfortunately, but until it creates massive, horrendeous resistance it's also cheaper and easier for farmers than properly taking care of large herds.  which is why we need, dare i say it, regulation.
just curious, pardon my ignorance, but do you know if it's possible to significantly increase the radioactive decay time by holding the element with a molecular bond?
i imagine that if any elements would be susceptible to major changes like this, it would be the highly unstable ones :-/
quite true, fixed
by "restrictive," they meant "you first have to pay a doctor $115."
use these services to verify that the correct procedure. like when the data retrieval is downloaded into a spreadsheet so restoring and analyzing analysts. it is also faster and more advanced methods will help to provide accurate results.
&gt;it would be helpful if gps were restricted to prescribing only when they have confirmation of bacterial infection.
you can't be talking about regulating health care?!  death panels!
but no, that is a completely reasonable assessment.  i would extend to say "reasonable suspicion" in cases of extreme illness where time may be short, but overall we should be regulating antibiotics much in the same way we regulate opiates to make sure that they're not being overprescribed.  they're a precious resource.
good post. way too many "scientists" and "physicists" who preach *theory* like it's proven science. this leads to overwhelming amounts of **confirmation bias** making it difficult for the curious mind to discern fact from fiction.
how about a healthy diet?
re: your last paragraph, i agree, and hopefully people understand this.  contrary to the idea that people with weakened immune systems would slow the evolution of bacteria down, because we treat them and keep them alive it's quite the opposite.  someone in this post mentioned xdr-tb, another example of this trend.
paper: http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.2963.html
i realize that and i'm saying that what i can get in the states otc is much more potent then what i can get here in ireland.
the us also has a drug culture, not all of these drugs are apis but a large portion of them are. that kind of culture doesn't exist in europe, at least not to the same extent. this is actually a to do with your statement. having to pay a doctor this amount of money means people are more likely to try self-medicating first. if you have free healthcare people will go to the doctor first and this means two things 1) we get to see what diseases are affecting people and log it with the public health departments and the who to develop cures against them and 2) they get the right medication, bearing in mind the right medication can sometimes be no medication.
i'm not saying free health care is the answer i am just saying that having to pay a premium to see a doctor actually encourages a less restrictive environment.
was it to penicillin? a good deal of people are actually allergic to it so they need a substitute, should bring that up to your doctor next time if you already didn't. 
i'm not saying zombies...but...zombies.

not sure if somebody else mentioned it but i mentioned xdr-tb below so was probably me again :p
while it's hard to doubt that this process is happening naturally somewhere in the universe, i think you_sir_are_wrong's post should stand on it's own merit. there needs to be a tag in askscience for when something enters the realm of "theory"... no matter how sure you are of that "theory", it's still a theory until confirmed by scientific process.

actually, the hiv link is crucial and what makes their finding novel. non-typhoidal salmonella (nts) infects humans from contaminated food all the time, nothing new in that. in this case, they found that nts can spread from humans to immuno-compromised humans (aids patients) directly, without going through an animal vector. this is what makes the whole study worthy of a paper in nature genetics.

&gt; it would be helpful if gps were restricted to prescribing only when they have confirmation of bacterial infection.
actually *confirming* infections is often expensive and time-consuming.  i'd say "when they have a reasonable suspicion"; e.g., if someone has a sinus infection that's already dragged on 7-10 days.
mmh. 
imho at such temperatures the radiation should really take care of the cooling, even surpassing an eventual contact heat diffusion. the energy radiated is proportionate to the power of 4 of the temperature: j = sigma * t ^^ 4

there is something more to the phenomenon. matter cannot stay that hot when the background is at a few kelvins. or maybe the law does not apply to clouds of particules?
&gt;i would extend to say "reasonable suspicion" in cases of extreme illness where time may be short
very true. *neisseria meningitidis* for example. like in most things you couldn't come up with a simple blanket rule like that and the last thing i would want would be a gp being hesitant about prescribing something that may save a persons life however having said that the majority of these cases would be hospital based treatment i would think and they would be exempt from this.

tbh, might as well just be animals that i haven't seen before. i'm waiting for  the discovery of a new species of lion with 12 legs or something. i know it's a big scientific thing, but i personally am always disappointed with new species.
&gt;actually confirming infections is often expensive and time-consuming.
not at all, its a simple plate assay. it does take about 24 hours but its incredibly cheap. in the mean time you can give the patient something to bring down the symptoms, it doesn't have to contain an api. there's very few diseases in the world that your symptoms would be subdued enough to go to a gp instead of a hospital where one day longer matters.
i think that free healthcare is part of the answer. see, americans believe that paying a high price for healthcare means that they should get what they want. doctors see us as customers as much as they see us at patients. they don't want to lose us as customers, so they prescribe us whatever we ask for.
basically, there needs to be a rule in place so that when some whiny patient comes in and *demands* antibiotics for their head cold, the doctor can point at it and go "sorry, hands are tied!"  because until then, too many gps just roll over and prescribe something to get irate "customers" off their back.
nobody changed their farming practices when there was a mad cow disease problem.
its stupid as long as the other farmer neighbour drives up in his bigger car, because he gives a shit and uses antibiotics, and you as a reasonal farmer didn't.
actually, we did.  as far as what we allowed into cow feed, we set rules to make sure that we weren't feeding cow protein to cows, which was what really started the whole shebang.  yes, we should change our farming practices to be more humane and sustainable, but cjd did cause some changes.  of course, i believe these changes were again due to regulation, not due to farmers deciding to be good people and spend more money.
people die from hiv worldwide from diseases no normal person would get. ever had a fungal infection in the lung? you and i most likely wouldn't but someone with aids would.
if you see no relation, then, you really need to understand your environment, a little better.
free healthcare works very well in sweden which has the best healthcare system in the world but it wouldn't work for everyone because it depends upon a certain culture and out look on life. america definitely doesn't have that and neither do most other countries to be honest. sweden is unusual. what you said is about capitalist tendencies is very true and thats why in theory free healthcare would be excellent. healthcare workers should not be worrying about their pay check, they should be focused on keeping people healthy.
its gonna be a hard one to fix but for now making healthcare more affordable is definitely the right direction. its hard to tell somebody they can't self-medicate when they can't afford the doctors fee.
you know what happens when you wait for the culture to come back (could take up to 10 days with some organisms)? yeah, the patient just died.
you must treat empirically and then you are able to change your regimen once you get your cultures back.
well, i agree with you about moderate religious people: i have no desire that they all become atheists. actually i have never been able to get excited about the whole atheist movement thing. i'm an atheist because i have realized, more or less involuntarily, that god is probably not real, but that has never seemed like a very important part of my identity, and i have no eagerness to spread it to others.
but i feel like we've drifted a little from the original topic. it seems important to make a distinction between three things:
1. anthropomorphism: permissible for use as a quick but sloppy way of describing something: as we carry a refrigerator up the stairs, i might gasp, "careful, it wants to slide to the left! no, your left!" but we don't actually believe the fridge has desires; we know its motions are described by newton's theory of gravity, which contains no anthropomorphism. and that is true for any other complex system we are trying to describe. *that includes descriptions of human beings:* we can't improve on anthropomorphic language right now because neurology is not advanced enough, but that is a statement about the present state of science, not the supernatural properties of the human brain. but even if we do understand something on a rigorous level, it seems harmless to use anthropomorphism in casual, everyday speech, as long as we do not take it literally. like with the refrigerator.
2. metaphor: used in almost all descriptions of any kind. even math statements can be interpreted as metaphors, or at least, my mind processes physics equations in a way that reminds me of how it processes metaphors. i am still pretty baffled by your assertion that there is some philosophical school that is against the use of metaphors in describing things; that has not been my experience. people are wary of anthropomorphism, yes, but anthropomorphisms are only a subset of metaphors.
3. moderate religion: it seems this has very little to do with the other two topics. moderation for me has mostly behavioral, not epistemic, connotations. i would expect a moderately religious person to be tolerant of people outside their religion, and perhaps ignore some of their own faith's more technical and stringent rules, but probably believe in a literal god in a literal heaven (or whatever). someone like you, who doesn't actually follow a religion, but is only interested in them in a scholarly or literary way, i would not call religious at all.
am i getting something very wrong here, or is that a good summing-up?
continents kept afloat by magic?
yeah although i don't think that is enough. the symptoms for a head cold are the same for god knows how many bacterial infections and what happens if the doctor misdiagnosed and the patient really did have a bacterial infection.
what they need is an ability to say good news!, i have done the test and discovered what you have isn't a bacterial infection so you won't need antibiotics, what i will give you is some pain killers to take the edge off the sympthoms but you should be healthy within 5 days. then if the patient says i want an antibiotic say i am sorry i would lose my medical license if i prescribe an antibiotic for a viral infection.
well.....there goes this week's sleep.
i've taken a z-pack once because i was going on vacation for a few days and was getting a terribly sore throat and just felt like shit (and since it was most like a strep infection, azithromycin would help). i'm typically sick for a week or more when this happens, but in two days in to the z-pack i felt fine. of course i finished the pack, but antibiotics can be helpful in situations such as these.
see?!? i could have spent hours on wikipedia and in libraries and instead some good soul just tells me in layman's terms.  thanks.
&gt;could take up to 10 days with some organisms
so i am a medical microbiologist and that's just completely false.
&gt;yeah, the patient just died.
incredibly unlikely. there's not really any diseases that kill you this quickly with minor symptoms. if you have major symptoms you go to a hospital. if you are going to die in 10 days without treatment you shouldn't be going to a pharmacy you should be going to straight to a hospital bed.
ahhh "make a man go crazy." such an interesting concept.
tis why apocalypse now redux is my favorite film :p i think we all need to go a little insane to understand life better.
we know that supernovae (type i and type ii) both occur.  we know that this is where heavy elements such as trus are created.  we know that there are trus flying around inside of supernova, and that when you hit two certain atoms together, a certain percent of the time, you'll get the resulting nucleus.
it's true, we haven't confirmed this (and i'd dare to say we never will be able to, given the amount of background in a sn), but we *do* know how the process works.  we know what is required to make it happen.  and we know that the insides of supernovae have those types of conditions for creating these nuclei (and just about every other nuclei you can possibly imagine).
this isn't like string theory where it's "well, we don't have any experiments to see if this nuclear process is possible or not."  we *know* that when you hit zn-70 and bi-209 nuclei together, they produce uut on the rare occasion (pending peer-review).  we know that these elements and isotopes exist inside of sn and in their exact aftermath.  we know that these things get accelerated to near the speed of light, meaning that you'd have every possible spectrum of energy to hit it.
this isn't a, "we've never observed it, so we don't know if it's true or not."  this is a, "we've driven our car on this road in france, and we've driven our car on this road in germany.  and we know that cars just like ours can drive on the roads in holland.  we're *pretty* sure that our car will also be able to be driven on dutch roads, even though we've never actually been there (and we'll ignore any possible laws of man)."
the universe is amazingly huge.  stars are huge.  sn have tons of energy with just about every single neutron-rich isotope (and their immediate decay products), and also thanks to fission, just about every single proton-rich isotope (and their immediate decay products).
so here is the crazy bit about american healthcare. the doctors stated fee for a visit is $115, but the only people who pay that are the people without insurance. insurance companies pay a "negotiated rate" which is much, much lower. probably somewhere near $25-$35. the insurance customer has a policy which states that customers have a co-pay of $25 per visit. so, basically, all of us pay 25% of our income to have some fuckers at the insurance company play a shell game with our money.
&gt;the symptoms for a head cold are the same for god knows how many bacterial infections and what happens if the doctor misdiagnosed and the patient really did have a bacterial infection.
which ones?  and even with similar symptoms, most illness of the sort will clear anyway with rest and relaxation.
unfortunately, but there are no foolproof tests, and there certainly aren't any that fast.  when you create one, then we can enact that policy, but until then we're better off limiting prescriptions in general.
eh, i think it's a bit irrational to apply the use of antibiotics in the tons to "farmer john" - rather, we're talking about companies like tyson and their billions of chickens.
okay, i'm all for stopping scammers before the nano-snake oil market takes more peoples money, but this study applied to a specific kind of delivery method, namely the slather and leave variety.  we already have tech that can essentially shoot streams of micro-droplets of medicine through the dermis and into the body, which is awesome, so it now becomes a matter of delivery.  i can easily see creams that come with a micro jet / vacuum pump and light system touted to both help inject nano particles in specific locations and activate them with specific wavelengths (for products that have an effect that is calculable and temporary).  i could sell products like that all day to people who didn't know it was dangerous and unwise to pump new small particles into the human body.  we need to upgrade the fda and all the systems in place that define medicine better, define delivery systems better, and we need to avoid blanket legislation aimed at avoiding the hard questions all together.  essentially i'm saying that just proving creams don't work as a nano medicine delivery technique will only move the money elsewhere, and the next step is one we can actually get to work, which makes it potentially an even more risky market to leave unaddressed until problems arise.
you're thinking of vitamin d. vitamin d enhances calcium absorption in the gi tract. if you take too much, you absorb way too much calcium and become hypercalcemic. the calcium deposits in your kidneys and causes calcification, among other serious issues.

paper: http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.2391.html
think of a [vacuum flask or a thermos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vacuum_flask). this is a liquid container that keeps hot fluids hot and cold fluids cold. the way it does that is to create a flask inside a flask with vacuum inside. since the inner flask isn't touching the outer flask more than at the top, there's no direct contact to transfer heat other than at the top of the flask, or through radiation.
now, think of intergalactic space as a huge vacuum flask. the "medium" that is insulating the thermos is the same medium as interstellar space consists of - vacuum.
tell your pharmacy/pharmacist as well
sounds exactly like a vaccine, except for the bugs.
says right in the article. flexible and transparent electronics, efficient solar cells and light emitting diodes. but the coolest applications are the ones we can't even think of yet....

[paper link](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3adoi%2f10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0046362) be nice to get some people smarter than i to weigh in on their process and results.
paper: http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1693.html
scary.
i have my own theories about hiv itself originating as a result of combined viruses in immunosuppressed people, but that's a different discussion for a different day.  if you look at the health of those hit hardest by hiv in the early days, you'll see what i mean--multiple std's, intestinal infections, drug use, unsafe sex practices and chronic antibiotic use were at epidemic levels leading up to the first cases of aids.  dr. selma dritz even "predicted" a fatal outbreak in gay men about 1 year before it happened.    
i sure wish it wasn't just a preview for me. any non-pay links to the full paper, or at least a derivative article?
thats the beauty of the nano-technology i was talking about. you can design specific "bots" to destroy specific pathogens. i doesn't matter how fast they mutate or what natural defenses they develop. every time they change, design a new "bot" to kill them. also, once you kill enough of the pathogens you reduce the pool they have to evolve from. it is akin to what was done to polio. of course we are a ways away from this, but still the idea is there.
no, molecular bonds deal with the electron orbits of the atom, not the nucleus. the two mostly do not affect each other, at least not in a significant way regarding radioactive decay times.
no need to apologize, it was a good question.
this just in. butch lesbians don't vote republican. 
i think this is cool
&gt;what i can get in the states otc is much more potent then what i can get here in ireland.
examples? naproxen (aleve) and a couple of allergy medications are the only notable new otc drugs i can think of that have emerged in the last decade. we also can't get codeine otc like you can in the uk.
we don't keep any animals, but as a grain farmer i can tell you that we supply the products that the market demands. it is as simple as that. case in point: in the past few years we have completely stopped growing gmo soybeans because the market has demanded that we grow non-gmo varieties.
the thing about legislating the problem away is that many people have to agree that is a problem that needs to be solved in the first place in order to push the legislation forward. however, if people agreed, then the market would make the problem go away on its own and the legislation wouldn't really be necessary.
&gt;which ones?
pertussis or tb (early stages) all the way down to a run of the mill strep throat. coughing, headache and fever are the symptoms for most diseases out there to be honest.
&gt;unfortunately, but there are no foolproof tests, and there certainly aren't any that fast.
well api kits are pretty good and that would be very fast. enrich and api it, few hours. problem is they are expensive.
&gt;but until then we're better off limiting prescriptions in general.
possibly although nothing we have suggested here will fly at a legislative level so the best thing to do right now is to put all the dollars and the iq points into developing novel therapeutics. i did a review on phage therapy last year, has excellent potential and it almost totally eliminates this problem because it co-evolves with the pathogen. i'm not sure we can solve the hurdles though :/
i don't think there are any antibiotics available otc in the usa.
i bought antibiotics otc easily in italy... about 10 years ago.
are you an algorithm? there is not a single coherent idea in your post. 
i think its awesome that in 60 years we go from splitting the atom to producing things that are not found in nature. all im trying to say is that unless we can make it last longer than a couple milliseconds it should not be classified as a new element
potentially not, take a look at the stuff about the "island of stability" stuff floating around. those elements are most likely still radioactive but are potentially more stable than the nuclides around them. but as for the things you can put on a shelf and expect to have it still be there in a year, yeah we probably found all of those already.
there's been speculation that this happens. if you wanna see something scarier, check out the transmittable cancer in tasmanian devils. it could never evolve in a regular population, but with enough immunosuppressed people we could actually allow such a disease to come about in humans
the applications for this could be huge. if we can control how cells function by giving them direct instructors, medical science may have just have some major break throughs on the horizon.
never seen so much apathy in medicine in america.
if you told a doctor "i'm allergic to penicillin" they'd go "cool then theres this or this, and also this works too, and this is a new thing, i'm going to go with this though as its had the most stable results in people such as yourself".  you'd tell the pharmacist and they'd be like "oh and here it is in generic, if you'd prefer".
the one great thing about the us healthcare system is that people actually give a damn.  not just the researchers, not just the doctors, not just the giant companies, but almost everyone.  
can plz also explane in simple english plz?
they give antibiotics out like candy in the us. there are many times that i have been prescribed antibiotics and i have refused to take them. we gotta be part of the solution, even if we'll just be one out of thousands... or millions..

very cool.
hey man. i see all your posts. are you a bot ?
i'm suddenly in 4th grade science again.
yes, this, any reputable pharmacist will tell you for sure.
we can't get codeine either. i mean it was 12.8mg but it was banned last year. i don't believe we can get naproxen either. 
do you remember the brand name?
some slow growing organisms can take long to grow. i'm just going off of our guy who teaches most of our antibiotics lectures who has been working at a top 10 hospital in the country for the past 30 or 40 years. i'm just learning a lot of this stuff but i think he knows what he's talking about. we were specifically given that 10 day sample because many labs throw out cultures if nothing grows in 7 days, but since this organism can take 10 days, a lot of labs will miss it.
and you honestly think everyone goes to the doctor/hospital after a week of symptoms? diabetic people have enormous fucking holes in their feet and they avoid the hospital. a lot of people also can't afford to not go to work so they can feed their children.
thx, now i got something to experiment with in work tomorrow
a semi-related question: why doesn't your body just keep replacing the white blood cells hiv kills off?  
oh, and fuck hiv.  
oh goodie, having to buy a new laptop/phone every time it rains.  (i know i know, it would be a spy thing)
this just in, the vatican declares this is the fault of condoms somehow (not really, thats a joke)
this proves that biology is just a belief like any other belief.
i get that, i was just supporting the semantics of good science.
yeah, pertussis does seem like a sort of cold (although when i had it i only coughed), but that's why the doctor waited until the test came back before prescribing me antibiotics.  which they should do in all cases except serious ones.  and active tb is likely to not be confused with anything else, and even if it is tb takes a very long, rigorous course of medication to clear--just prescribing any old antibiotic won't help anyway so, again, waiting for the test is very indicated.  strep throat is something that has some pretty distinct clinical symptoms (the appearance of the throat), but again, nothing that you can't wait for a strep test before prescribing.
i would love to put tons of dollars and research into novel therapeutics, but they can only go so far and remain expensive.  from a practical, public health standpoint (which is where my background is), limiting prescription is the first and best option to reducing resistance.
could you clarify your statement about antibiotics being a misnomer/not actually curing infection? my understanding is that abs act directly on bacterial cells walls to induce apoptosis and/or inhibit cell division, quite literally killing off infection. without a healthy immune system, more infections can strike and face less resistance once they do (allowing more time to multiply and/or evolve), thus posing a greater risk. in this way, it's not that antibiotics *can't* eradicate infections, it's that alone, they're not always fast enough. 
&gt;some slow growing organisms can take long to grow.
not 10 days, some organisms can be slow to grow on agar which is why you enrich them before plating. 
&gt;i'm just learning a lot of this stuff but i think he knows what he's talking about.
i am sure he he does and i would encourage you to ask him this question when you see him next because, and no offense intended here, i think you have heard one thing in a certain context and made a general rule.
for example staph at the bottom of its cardinal values has a generation time for a couple of days. whoever when you plate it then you're talking 20 minutes or so because you are giving it ideal conditions. 
i'm a medical microbiologist so with respect i know what i am talking about as well :p
&gt;and you honestly think everyone goes to the doctor/hospital after a week of symptoms? diabetic people have enormous fucking holes in their feet and they avoid the hospital. a lot of people also can't afford to not go to work so they can feed their children.
if you ever want any hope of being a scientist you need to do two things. one, accept you are going to be wrong 90% of the time. even when you know you're shit you are going to be wrong a lot of the time so get used to it and don't get so insulted when you are. just learn from it.
and two stop getting so defensive. this is basically the same thing as the first one but i am going to repeat it. you won't learn if you are defensive all the time.
to answer your question if they don't go to the gp then ab resistance isn't an issue is it. diabetic people that have holes in their feet most certainly do go to hospital or they go to a morgue. anyways the cost of healthcare is a whole different debate and not one i feel like having with somebody that is not open to the possibility that he is wrong.
repost!
not one of you has raised the fact that we are using a different species for testing cures for humans.  we do not have the same dna as they do so how accurate can this testing really be?  if you do the research, you will find that several medications that passed animal testing went on to cause many human deaths.  many medicines that didnt pass animal testing were found decades later to cure diseases in humans.  the only reliable test subject for products or medicine is the same species as what is planning on using these products.  anything else is a waste of time and effort.  it is also causing needless suffering for another species.  people who think these test subjects dont suffer are lying.  right here in the u.s. the laws are very vague in regards to using animals for research.  "all animals must be treated for pain unless it interferes with the testing"  how much more vague can you get there.....  we all have heard stories of the holocost and all of the humans they used as research subjects and the horror they lived with.  its our worst nightmare....and knowing that, how can you ethically use another living being that feels pain just like we do, in an experiment?  add in the fact that you could get just as accurate results from flipping a coin?  
i disagree that the market is the answer to every problem because at the moment the market is simply too confusing for the average consumer to be a "well-educated" consumer, which would be necessary for market controls to work.
and even if people get together and decide that something is or isn't good, they may not be right.  for instance, i tentatively disagree with the public's opinion about gmo crops and i wholeheartedly disagree with a large, vocal portion of the public in their opinions on vaccines.  we need scientists and experts for a reason.
i think we're likely to see well-researched, intelligent consensus among scientists about antibiotic useage in agriculture long before the market will correct the problem.
was looking for something like this. thank you.
sorry it was too long ago, but there were several to choose from
i asked for it specifically by name (i was taking a course prescribed in the us but had forgotten my pills) ... something -cilin probably haha

yup all in the first paragraph is very true. just pointing out the symptoms are similar. its not out of the realm of possibility that they could misdiagnose and maybe the person ends up in hospital as a result in which case the doctor could get sued or whatever.
&gt;but they can only go so far and remain expensive.
well the idea with funding research for anything is to discover how to make them go further for cheaper. 
&gt;from a practical, public health standpoint (which is where my background is), limiting prescription is the first and best option to reducing resistance.
i don't feel that's practical because it would never fly in washington. education might help though, it works reasonably well for the food industry.
if you multiply that function by a you will recover power, which is just change in energy/change in time. you can solve such an equation for change in time and then integrate. here is my calculation for the [amount of seconds required for the body to reduce its temperature by 10%.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%2860e9%2f%286.02e23*1.6e-19%298%29%2f%282*5.6e-8*%282*pi*%28.5e5*365*24*60*60%29%5e2+%2b%28.3*100*365*24*60*60%29%282*pi*.5e5*365*24*60*60%29%29%29+*+%281%2f%28.9%282e6%29%29%5e3+-1%2f%282e6%29%5e3). i find that it takes only about 10^-23 seconds..... haha.
so obviously we made a wrong assumption. most likely, we should not approximate that gas as one object. further, i might so postulate that the gas will reabsorb a lot of its own energy. given that the gas is fairly diffuse, nucleons/volume= ((60e9)/1.6e-27)/(1e61) ~ 10^3 nucleons per cubic meter and... isotropic? that explanation would seem probable. not sure.(note that i approximated the volume the gas occupies as the volume the milky way occupies, the article seems to suggest that as a minimum value)
the unseen hand of the market will protect us.

how much longer are you going to keep africa on life-support for fucks sake, leave them the hell alone, and let the laws of nature dictate who will emerge there as worthy of leading a civilization.
i love her videos :d
omg - that sounds awful bro :( - hope ya okay now!
how exactly are they playing god? 
it begins...
it's highly unlikely that someone is going to end up in the hospital from strep or even pertussis.  and if they do, i'm all for using antibiotics in severe cases, as mentioned.
&gt;i don't feel that's practical because it would never fly in washington.
it will if you brand it right.  call it the "protecting our antibiotic resources" or "preventing drug-resistant infections" bill.  there's plenty of public support for anything that prevents mrsa, ever since mrsa became a buzzword.
the time line just keeps getting pushed further and further back. though this doesn't really relate to this particularly, i can't wait until there's no way for scholars to deny that advanced civilizations existed much further back then they are currently willing to admit
edit: i should probably clarify that i don't mean 'advanced' as in our current level of advancement, but much more advanced then we view people of that time now. 
over our dead bodies, mr. oman. what you're proposing will sign our country's evolutionary death warrant!
yup very true. if i took a petridish full of strep and pour pen. v on it then they would all die. however the human body isn't a dish and when we are talking about these things we are generally talking about in vivo. so when talking in vivo we need to remember two things. the body isn't a petri-dish, is a very very complex environment with lots of places for bacteria to evade anti-bacterial agents and secondly the dose required to kill the infection would likely kill, or severely harm, the patient.
when i talk about a misnomer i mean people think you take a course of antibiotics and the antibiotics kill the infection which is not really true. some abs do kill, some abs disable, some abs slow. the mode of action can vary but the end goal is always the same for a human antibiotic and that is to enable the immune system to clear the infection. not to kill the infection, hence the misnomer.
&gt;in this way, it's not that antibiotics can't eradicate them, but that they're not always fast enough.
well its mostly because the moa isn't going to kill them or the dose isn't large enough. time can be an issue but like we can see in diseases like tb we can put people on abs for a long long time provided their is constant pressure on the bacteria.
no government is going to make legislation if only the scientists, and not the general population, can agree. taking away the right to cheap hamburger from the average person would be political suicide, unless you can also convince them that paying more for their meat is better for everyone. by the time you have convinced the population of the merits, they will have stopped buying the antibiotic-filled meat and the problem is gone long before legislation can be enacted.
what you want is a full new genus, at least. something far more divergent than a species which is the lowest level of distinction between organisms (other than the individual).
i'm not sure what you're saying.  i expect the co2 levels to keep rising for the next 300 years or more.
as usual, top comment delivers!
personally i fucking love the name "enigmatic porcupine". i imagine him speaking to the other woodland animals in bizarre little non-sequiturs leaving them nonplussed but somehow satisfied.  
are you a doctor? can you cite a source that indicates alcohol impairs antibiotic efficacy?
shit like this is the only hope the rest of the species on the planet have.
hmm... apparently a dude i work with is a co-author on this paper. my initial reaction was "this paper is cool, i should discuss it with my coworker down the hall! oh wait... he's an author".
yeah good on kaitlyn sawyer getting her big break.
about 4 years ago i was chatting with a chap from my tennis club, he in involved with some top secret stuff he wasn't able to say too much about. he said to me that the fix to the shortage of fossil fuels and batteries just not doing the trick lay in south america... (sugar?)
this might be the real deal chaps!
nobody cares why you're upvoting.
i figured he wasn't part of the peruvian slide show. and it's a monkey that inhabits a tropical forest environment so i'm not surprised it's endangered. isn't the monkey actually from myanmar though? not that it really changes its situation to be honest. 
but..their evolution is two fold. they develop multi-resistance to antibiotics, but they also are selected for lower symptoms versions. the patients are already immune compromised, so a fatal bacterial infection would likely kill the patient before evolving resistance. 
what should keep us up at night is an animal bacteria picking up drug resistance. in such a case, you could have an antibiotic resistant bacteria that is adapted to birds, crossing over and killing people with no effective means of treatment. 
we will eventually regulate antibiotic usage on other species, but i suspect we will have to wait for a pandemic before we do so.

the link doesn't seem to work for me. is this article implying that the event responsible for creating the moon occurred only 12,000 years ago?
insightful point. i suspect you'd see pathogens evolve to be slower and cause less symptoms.
like mobile phones, computers, aeroplane travel...
"people demanded non gmo varieties" 
one of the problems with market demand is people are idiots. some soccer mom saw on oprah that gmo may be bad and suddenly a wonderful product like gmo soybeans isn't being used. 
label a product "pink slime" and within a month a company with a 20 year history of producing 100% safe products shuts down 3/4th of their plants.  professionals need to be part of the system because there are too many whacko environmentalists spreading fake fear. if a general consensus from real scientists on animal antibiotics is overused than something might have to be done. 
a free market was shown not to work? when?
tb was very nearly eradicated and is now coming back due to immunosuppressed patients and this has been known for at least a decade.

also, fungus has had this planet covered in a biological internet for a long time

why on earth would you expect co2 levels to keep rising long after we stop burning fossil fuels?
also, [this kept on popping up in my mind](http://i.imgur.com/ik6r6.jpg)
that might be a good research topic for them. my own experience tells me that people are generally more engaged visually. for example, i can filter out almost anything when i watch an exciting match or movie, and my gf always complain how i ignore her. on the other hand, it looks like people can do many house chores/works that don't require a lot of attention when they listen to radio/music. so i guess visual attention is a lot more taxing than verbal attention and therefore leads to the invisible gorilla effect.
you say that as though there is a conspiracy or agenda, surely they wouldn't care if there were new data and would be as excited as anyone to find something that changes the current thinking, they just interpret the evidence they have and report the dates they suggest for these things.
this is still a problem, 1 in 5 gay men has hiv.  your comment, along with this one, should start getting down votes pretty soon because even though it's the truth it's not pc.  give a redditor a choice between pc and true, they'll pick pc every time.

hydrogen can burn in an internal combustion engine, while atomic hydrogen atoms can produce excess energy on recombining into h2. both processes can be used for energy extraction

beyond einstein's horizon
‚Äústudy of energy waves formed during the big bang supports einstein‚Äôs prediction that a strange, invisible force is pushing the universe apart‚Äù
http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/340163/title/for_kids_%e2%80%98ruler%e2%80%99_to_measure_space
a. from  universe-energy-mass-life compilation
http://universe-life.com/2012/02/03/universe-energy-mass-life-compilation/ 
from the big-bang it is a rationally commonsensical conjecture that the gravitons, the smallest base primal particles of the universe, must be both mass and energy, i.e. inert mass yet in motion even at the briefest fraction of a second of the pre big bang singularity. this is rationally commonsensical since otherwise the big would not have banged, the superposition of mass and energy would not have been resolved.
the universe originates, derives and evolves from this energy-mass dualism which is possible and probable due to the small size of the gravitons.
since gravitation is the propensity of energy reconversion to mass and energy is mass in motion, gravity is the force exerted between mass formats.
all the matter of the universe is a progeny of the gravitons evolutions, of the natural selection of mass, of some of the mass formats attaining temporary augmented energy constraint in their successive generations, with energy drained from other mass formats, to temporarily postpone, survive, the reversion of their own constitutional mass to the pool of cosmic energy fueling the galactic clusters expansion set in motion by the big bang.
b. from:  21st century science whence and whither
http://universe-life.com/2011/12/13/21st-century-science-whence-and-whither/
1. dark energy and matter yok. per   e=total[m(1 + d)]  all the energy and matter of the universe are accounted for.
adopt space mass distance concept, constant rate mass-to-energy reconversion.  
2. higgs particle yok. mass forms below some value of the above d. all mass formats evolve from the gravitons.
3. galactic clusters formed by conglomeration?
no. galactic clusters formed by big-bang's fragments dispersion, evidenced by their newtonian behavior including their separation acceleration. 
4. the universe expansion is fueled by the mass-to-energy constant rate reconversion. eventually, as expansion will slow down, will run out of massfuel, gravity will overcome expansion and initiate empansion back to singularity. the universe is a cyclic array of energy-mass dualism, between nearly all-energy and all-mass poles, under omnipresent gravity. gravity is the monotheism and re-genesis of the universe.

those assholes need to stop eating mcdonalds and get to the gym. lazy obese flies. 
i wouldn't.  from what i understand there's probably 50 years left of oil, but 300 years worth of coal.
actually, al gore developed world's first electronic dna.
well actually, tb was very nearly eradicated in most first world countries.  it was still seen in homeless populations, but always stayed at a low roar and was not seen as a threat.  immunosuppressed patients are at much higher risks.  but the fact is tb is coming back largely because first world countries (namely the us) got lazy about actively preventing its spread.
i don't really see it as an agenda, more so people not wanting to accept new evidence that contradicts what they already believe. don't be get wrong, i'm not discrediting scholars entirely, but a good block of them don't want the foundation of their ideals to be shook to the extent that it has been the last couple decades. 
hell, they are still trying to claim gobekli tepe was constructed by hunter/gathers
the unnecessary capitalization in your title is...distracting.
yeah, basically all of south america sells antibiotics otc, no questions asked.
i agree. more likely than not the next pandemic will be triggered by the farming of animals to be used for food. the practice of factory farming breeds disease at a much more alarming and consistent rate than some isolated examples of compromised immune systems from hiv.
as a pharmacy student i'm sorry to hear that.  we tend to take penicillin allergies pretty seriously here (in the us).  that said, cross-reactivity between different beta-lactams is quite varied.  there are several penicillin "derivatives" that would not likely be harmful.  
but isn't the definition of evolution that the strongest survive?  so, if these people are immunosuppressed, why would the pathogens need to evolve.  i would just think that it makes their job easier.  why would the lack of an immune system require evolution?
&gt;we can now send any dna message we want to specific cells within a complex microbial community.
what could *possibly* go wrong?
as a guy who modifies copyrighted and warrantied hardware for cash on the side, i'd say how horribly this would be enforced would make it a gutless rule. that and it would be the legislative collective saying "we have to protect corporations from the innovation of the private citizens". unlikely, but still scary. 
i begrudgingly agree.
we may have had previous human civilizations as avanced as we are now. even nukes, electronics, and all of our fantastical shit.  most people dismiss this out of hand.
seriously though, what would be left of our civilization 65,000 years from now?  probably not even building foundations, most metals would have rusted to dust, probably just a few shards of broken glass to signify that mankind had even ever existed.
but if you get cancer you get a 50-year old treatment..
i'll just contribute by mentioning, that specialized areas that it is especially useful for, will be where it makes it's first inroads.
i work in gallium arsenide semiconductors....they're used in certain things that silicon isn't as good for, primarily high frequency applications.
thanks for the link!  i've read a lot about the early days of hiv and am very interested in the true origins of aids.  no disrespect intended to any group, but it seems plausible from a medical standpoint.  if different hiv strains can combine to form a "superstrain", why couldn't hiv arise from a combination of other viral particles in an immuno-suppressed person?  
and yes, i was prepared for downvotes before i even typed it.  bring on the hivemind swarm! ;)
well, i'd like to start stockpiling carbon so i have all the supply...
what defines  european culture 
i too concur.  stuff that exists in fact exists.  
of course they do. fear of mortality make you want there to be more after this life. 
could this type of cell communication be used to create a militarized supervirus?
it's leaving the [solar system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_system).. not the [galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galaxy)
well actually the developed world has done an awesome job in getting rid of tb. in the us foreign born people consist of 60% of all tb cases. then you figure on 1 in 8 tb cases are seen in hiv patients. you come to the conclusion that the us has virtually eliminated tb except for cases where the vectors are people from other countries or where it's been unable to be successfully treated in hiv patients.
history repeats itself and we are more than due for a population devastating super disease.

actually, they call themselves 'nippon' or 'nihon'., the language 'nihon-go' and the people 'nihonjin'. (it's been years since my japanese, so people can feel free to correct me).
i've always felt it was roman, germanic, and gallic roots. ianah, though.
it is amazing that thirty years ago, only science fiction would even dare to  print this kind of information. i hope in another thirty years science will develop the system to cure me of my old age. i can keep going to the gym but, eventually, my body will decline faster than i can grow. i would be incredible to have an opportunity to live without the assistance of walkers or wheelchair. 
i do not understand question. which table.
of course, there's only one direction the timeline could ever be pushed, right?  it's only natural that the more we find, the  earlier and earlier our timelines will get.  probably it starts to look asymptotic though.

physician = medical doctor
physicist = what you wanted
but a pathogen evolving in an immune-systemless environment wouldn't even be too deadly would it? i would assume that these pathogens would not be very effective against a healthy immune system. am i wrong? or does the free reign of a human body without the immune system to stop it provide the pathogen with the means to mutate into something lethal for the general population.
that's not what the article said. and i suppose it is being downvoted because people don't like the study's findings...very science minded. ignore it if it doesn't fit my agenda!
correct me if i have this completely wrong, but it would seem to me that a new strain would be less likely to evolve in immunosupressed people, since there is less of an environmental necessity for the virus (or bacterium) to evolve.
i've heard they're best for women that have already had kids, and i have not. 
there is a typo in the article where they say they found an area in the atmosphere at 175 c.  they mean kelvin, and it is confirmed when you look at the figure.  needs more editing :(

thank you.
this is common sense. why are there articles being written about this?
well, the problem with these numbers is that we often don't actively screen homeless populations, and these individual tend not to seek out care.
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6128a5.htm
i'm not saying that hiv doesn't play a major role in tb, it [clearly](http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/content/162/2/460.full) does.  i'm just saying that another large factor is the general tendency to ignore the health concerns of homeless populations.  in the case of tb (which can easily spread), allowing this vector to continue is rather irresponsible, yet a focus on treatment/prevention in this group has only really been seen in the last 5 or so years.
the stuff is difficult to make and identify, there is some debate about the results.
you can never tell what something might be used for some day, or what you could learn from it, until after you've had a chance to study it.
when lasers were first invented, a lot of people were like "so what, it's a fancy light bulb"
not only do lasers have everyday uses, they also enable other devices to be constructed (using lasers, or laser cutting, etc), that would not have been possible before.

i'd be curious to see if other materials might behave differently. they've shown polystyrene doesn't cross the skin, but perhaps something else might. my materials science spidey-senses are tingling.
you are correct. 
what i meant is japanesse/japan is how the country and its people are referred to in english, in a wholly respectful manner. so even if this element were named japonium, it wouldn't be insulting, or meant as such anyway.

i was worried that a natural virus could mutate and take advantage. i didn't even think of a man-made virus. my guess is there is no fail-safe mechanism... yet. the biggest threat - cancer.
i dont understand things too well, but this sounds like eventually i can put some of this shit in me and interface with other augmented biological systems, ala crysis suit.
&gt; are there any possible applications for this "discovery"
there is insufficient information to answer this question at this time.
they asked that about the internet once, long ago :-)
when someone builds a time machine, i'll let you know the answer to your question.
also, the article said that the ints was commonly found in children who were  immunocompromised as a result of malnutrition, not hiv. from what i understand, it's the compromised state that led to the development and not specifically hiv.
i'm sorry if it seemed that way but i don't know how it's disconnected with the survey rating women's bodies on level of attractiveness. also, i don't think the researchers have enough date composed to even propose the statements they did. i whole-heartedly agree with you that attractiveness doesn't automatically equate objectification but i think the research did automatically equate attractiveness with objectification. 
if that's true that's pretty disturbing. and yet...kinda cool. 
i don't think they even know how to make a gate out of this stuff.  the advantage is that it's cheaper, not faster.
a couple of things.  individuals with hiv don't lack an immune system...they are just immunocompromised.  as in they are lacking in certain, important, areas of the immune system as they develop aids.  secondly, a lot of these pathogens aren't an issue for us with fully competent immune systems (until one day we become immunocompromised by disease or age?).  the important thing to note, is this study does not show any evidence that bacteria in immunocompromised individuals are somehow turning into super-bugs that can kill healthy people in the regular population.  it is just saying that immunocompromised individuals are carry this bug and can be a reservoir for it...which is in turn effecting other immunocompromised people.
edit:  for the record, i am a microbiologist, but i do not work on hiv specifically.  i am familiar with it, as i work in a department with several well respected scientists in the hiv field...but that is my extent of knowledge.
i can't help but picture a giant vat of 'thinking' liquid that glows florescent yellow in the middle of a warehouse lab with scientists everywhere holding tablets and checking readings and vitals of the system.
and a slip.
i'm sorry you're right, it's myanmar.
nobody is advocating the burning of fossil fuels until they're gone. its one of the big flaws of the agw movement...the strange notion that if you're not advocating the immediate switch to currently available (and unworkable) renewable technologies...you're for the burning of fossil fuels forever.
the other flaw of course is that the climate is not very sensitive to co2 and never has been.  the sad, hidden reality of climatology is that you cannot separate the sensitivity of co2 levels to climate...from the sensitivity of climate to co2.  go ahead and look, no paper exists...if you ask you'll be directed to an estimate based on the correlation, but the correlation is by nature temperature driven.  if co2 had no ability to absorb energy but the temperature rose and fell by the same amounts...we literally could not tell the difference. (we would obviously know that it wasn't to blame though if it couldn't absorb)
in fact, the evidence is quite clear that the sensitivity of the climate is low during interglacials.  you see it in ice cores...the temperature swings are much smaller.  you see it in the actual behavior of the planet...here we are languishing at the same temperatures for over a decade and we're only .4c to .5c higher than the temperatures of the 1940s.  we're right on track for a total of about 1.2c, assuming co2 is even the biggest component.  we've also recently come out of the most pronounced and longest running solar minimum of the entire interglacial...into the modern maximum...a period of some of the highest of the interglacial (and apparently the most pronounced change of the interglacial)
i've said it so many times...this agw movement will go down in history as the worst failure of science.  a tiny grain of truth grown into an all-corrupting wave of worthless, crappy "research"...laughable worst case scenarios that are themselves assuming the laughable worst case scenarios of other research.
doesn't the diagram imply there are areas of venus which are about 70f? perhaps home to life?
planted! that is a test.of your faith right there! right next to a dinosaur skull... no wait, those are further down to further test us!
i'd note that if the problem is being immunosuppressed, then the problem's bigger then hiv. 
today's gedankenexperiment: if you had a transplant patient who was immunesuppressed, and they were exposed to the nastiest pathogens around (say, in a hospital...) and the very best modern medicine was used to keep them alive, wouldn't that produce some pretty nasty germs fairly quickly? 
they're more than 60 miles up in the atmosphere and pretty narrow. it would be awfully hard for anything we'd recognize as life to exist in conditions like that. 
if it was discovered that animal bodies could produce more body fat than were consumed in calories it would be the scientific discovery of all time. paving the way for a gruesome supply of unlimited energy from harvesting animal fats, much like the whale slaughter of the 19thc.
you should have this discussion with someone who knows more about it than i do.  i can't tell if you're baffling me with bullshit, or dazzling me with brilliance.
what people are advocating, and what we are actually doing is two different things.  so long as oil is cheap we'll use it until either it's gone, or it becomes too expensive.  that's not what anyone wants, but it's how we do things.
well, no. not forever. heat (energy) is dissipated through radiation, but this is a very slow process.
assuming that the "coffee mug" is a closed container (otherwise the liquid would evaporate as the lower pressure in vacuum (ie, zero) lowers the boiling point of the liquid), this hot coffee could stay hot for a very long time.
heat dissipation is actually a major problem for space craft. it's not difficult to heat a spacecraft, you just need to add energy, but cooling it is a problem as you don't have anything to transfer the excess heat to, except other parts of the spacecraft.

guatemala is not in south america :p and i can't talk for every country but i live in argentina and, acording to the regulations, you need a prescription. but, you can get a prescription very easily (just call the doctor or go to the hospital and they will give you one) and not all the pharmacies really ask for the prescription if it as a common drug like amoxicilin or something like that.
so all those moisturizers are bs?

does anyone remember a book from the 70's titled
*"the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind"?*
it hypothesized a change in human brain structure about 50,000 years ago; and bang! suddenly we were doing art.
outdated now; but one of my favorite titles ever.
wow this is fascinating! this was really well explained, thanks for your time brother.
i know where guatemala is.  latin america and south america are very similar cultures in many ways, is why i was making the comparison.  is it new in argentina to require a prescription?  in chile, these things are sold over the counter.  i think in brazil too.
&gt; we may have had previous human civilizations as avanced as we are now. even nukes, electronics, and all of our fantastical shit. most people dismiss this out of hand.
highly unlikely. our civilization got to the point where it is at currently, through dependence of fossil fuels. a comparable civilization 63,000 years ago would have had to use fossil fuels as well. we've also hit peak oil in little over a century.
ah yes. the infamous hi-tech medication use in african husbandry. dude - they do it as freerange as it gets.  
i mean, i'm all for not overusing antibiotics - but this ain't it.

actually, there are many governments where that can happen. and that's exactly the government we should strive for.
&gt;by the time you have convinced the population of the merits, they will have stopped buying the antibiotic-filled meat and the problem is gone long before legislation can be enacted.
so you, as a person that should be able to understand it, use the ignorance of the population as an excuse to exploit their stupidity for your own profits while making shitty decisions.

as someone who's worked on a political campaign and is from a family that has been involved in politics in some form or another for a few generations (less so now than in the past,), i can assure you that there is in fact, almost always cake. and if you're the candidate, it can be whatever cake you want, as long as you can afford it. 
the only downside is that you have to share with your supporters. which is an upside if you're a volunteer. campaign cakes are yummy.

http://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-bioengineers-introduce-biological-internet
article from stanford. 
http://www.jbioleng.org/content/6/1/16/abstract
provisional version of the paper (big fat pdf available). 
no; the writer supposed there was a change in the interaction of the left and right lobes of human brains, with a 'holistic' effect of modern  consciousness occurring only a few thousand years ago. 
it wouldn't be reflected in fossils (he supposed) but in the change of mere tool-making primates into  beings that expressed a heightened awareness of personal identity.
it's more poetry than biology at this point; and i don't think it was ever peer-reviewed.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicameralism_(psychology)
 
yep. not to mention super-structures and moving of huge chunks of land like we have kind of is hard to miss.  for instance chicago jets out into lake michigan by quite a bit after their 1870's fire.  i-68 in md has this:
http://www.millenniumhwy.net/washington_cd_2004/pict1065.jpg
kind of hard to miss that kind of building even after 63,000 years.  those rocks won't just disappear in that time.
he must be from further in the future when time travel gets "perfected".
well, i suppose it's possible that a fossil could be re-evaluated and found to be younger than was originally thought, due to some kind of mistake made in the original analysis. that would push the timeline back toward the present.
that's just the sort of thing they say in star trek, before a swarm of killer venusian space-fleas attack the crew.

i thought you said archeologists don't want to "accept new evidence."
well, it existed for a time t-t0&gt;0, so for a moment there was an atomic nucleus with 113 protons.
and if it cannot be made more stable than that, then that is how long it can exist and therefore, is not a partial description of the element. so, it's element 113 regardless of the fact that it existed for only a couple of milliseconds. besides, a millisecond is not a very small amount of time.
&gt;you are seriously advocating for some tyrannical
no.
&gt;where there is a ruling class handing down edicts to the public?
which is describing the situation of today way better than anything i would advocate. it seems you severely misunderstand your position in society and the concept of democracy.
come back if you have a serious question rather than a loaded one. you haven't made a point, so don't expect further answers if you continue that dishonest behaviour.
how about zipangium?
even with the technology we have there is not much we can do if we find an asteroid heading directly towards us. i am just wondering if this is not a cycle the earth goes through every 5 000 or so years and is in direct relation to the mayan calendar, would be really interesting to know, but i guess we never will.
actual paper [http://www.jbioleng.org/content/6/1/16/abstract](http://www.jbioleng.org/content/6/1/16/abstract)
the mantle is only a few miles down, the issue is the deeper you drill twords it, the denser the material you're drilling through gets, the hotter it gets, and the risk of hitting a pocket of exploding gas increases with each additional foot.
the "inner core" of the earth is indeed impossible to get to as no known metal we can make drillbits from can withstand the temperatures or pressure long enough to get to it and return samples.
source: i watched bill nye once.
this can really help reveal a lot about the mechanics of molecular interactions, not to mention a lot of ideas which are purely theoretical can now have visible supporting evidence. also, can't wait to see the impact this has on students. should really help out chem and biochem students. 
check the sources, wikipedia is, like most of the internet, full of lies.
the source for that information is an article about element 117.
edit: never mind, it seems that the research on element 117 predicts some properties for 113 and because 117 decays through alpha into 115 and 115 decays through alpha into 113, it's possible that they actually had some 113.
edit2: it sucks that the source article is behind a paywall, otherwise i'd check directly. god damn for-profit institutions.
nice try mitt romney. 
indeed this is the problem.  look through the thread.  how many people bring up your gloom and doom concerns.  how many of them do you think are like you?
if you want people in the future to believe you used to exist you need to write something about your times.
this is /r/science, not /r/til
he wonders why unstable elements are on the periodic table.
the answer to that is: because the periodic table has nothing to do with stability or half-life, it's strictly about how many protons are in the nucleus. if it has a nucleus with protons, it goes on the periodic table, end of discussion.
how much change does it do [to this map](http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/)? they're saying this is groundbreaking, but it seems like they're just pushing when migrations occurred to an earlier point in time.

pretty interesting novel based on this idea, don't mean to hijack but i love this book.  http://www.amazon.com/canticle-leibowitz-walter-miller-jr/dp/0060892994/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1349119889&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=a+canticle+for+leibowitz
i agree that its highly unlikely but in 63k years there would be very little left.  watch the life after people shows on tlc.  they are very informative.  
i'm pretty sure that does, in fact happen, but it's ripples against the tide of continuous new discoveries.
material evidence, perhaps. but it would be extremely obvious that they would have used fossil fuels. also, if they had nukes, evidence would be there if we could find traces of long-lived fission products.
he's proposing shit like this and you're expecting a consistent, lucid, and reality-based decision process? (just turning a phrase, not trying to insult you)
no.  just no.  as they said, this finding is already in line with what was suspected from genetic data.  there are no atlantean civilizations.  although e.g. the indus valley is unknown and early, it's not earlier than the established advent of agriculture.
the real advances will be in determining how fully modern humans interacted with other hominin species in the novel environments, how/why the extinctions of other hominins and other megafauna occurred and how modern humans may have effected this, when/how such populations of fully modern humans were displaced by the populations we see there today, etc.
hmmm... one ice age, coming up!
he's a troll, no feeding.
i think the phrase is early modern?  they're not the same as modern humans.
also, there's the question of behavioral modernity as well as physical modernity. 
he's a troll, no feeding.
this skeleton doesn't tell us anything about whether it was behaviorally modern.
highly irrelevant to the point i just made.
edit: i see i misunderstood what you were saying by "we already have anatomically modern human remains that are around 200,000 years old."  meh.
haha...core was one hell of a movie! someone took it a little far tho dont you think! 
good luck trying to push graham hancock around here. i love the man's work, but generally get downvoted into oblivion for even thinking his name as i type up comments
i believe unobtainum will not only withstand the temperatures and pressure but it will actually get stronger the hotter and deeper you go!
that makes absolutely no sense.
you're saying that previous studies established more than this study did?
"i'm going to wear a faraday cage."    
‚Ä¶and i am unimpressed.
arcattack did it first.
so, is al gore going to plant me some more trees, or did i get ripped off with that carbon offset i purchased?
that makes absolutely no sense. 
if, during flu season, doctors would rate the attractiveness of everyone who came to see them... and everyone had flu symptoms, the results would be skewed in a particular direction that would not be seen amongst the general populace.
i love your level of certainty in saying "no, there were absolutely no  advanced civilizations before what is currently accepted". 
when did granite a intrude? after what event and before what event? did it intrude before or after fault xy?
i thought it was going to be a metaphor and some 1% apologia and was ready to get angry. got angry anyway.
and that, folks, is what you get for sticking it up the butt.
seriously, how is this man allowed to make rules? this goes to show that the people in charge (not all but seemingly a good proportion) are in it for personal / business gain and fame. this man wants to stifle creativity and ingenuity. seriously, in the age of technology, this shit has to stop. the idea should not even be entertained!
/r/fractals would like tihs a lot.
wait... ken__m? that troll... didn't even notice who i replied to.
abstract here:

before you go any further, define "advanced civilization".  we have a pretty firm grasp on the advent of pastoralism or agriculture.  these are required to have dense human populations.  there may be revisions back in time, but most certainly not into the paleolithic as you seem to imply.
btw, civilizations = "city living".
try telling that to the parents who complained that pe was over-exerting their already overweight children. my old school went from 1mile run per week to 1 per month. oh and if you can't run as much because you're already horrendously overweight for your age? just waddle 3/4 of that. it'll be ok.
typo. he meant to say 6000
no, you don't. if you're referring to chemotherapy, the name is the only thing that's the same. although i suspect that making this point will just be ignored.
no doubt you also think there's a super-duper secret cure for cancer? even though "cancer" is thousands of different ailments often with little connection to each other? even though the banker elite continue to die from cancer too?

can't tell if troll or sincere. :(
but yeah, there's a lot of stuff stacked against us for getting out of the universe.
the granite is not split by the fault. think about that.
i'm talking about the gas in our halo, not the universe.(obviously dark matter had a hand in shaping clusters and galaxies, but i wasn't referring to that.)
or at least an immitator
wow, sensationalize much? 
pffft, anyone who's ever grown weed indoors and experimented with the tailpipes of a 1969 vw superbeetle could have told you that.
but no one asked me.
i feel this is much needed worldwide, living in america especially this becomes obvious. 
there has been a noticeable drop in the levels of critical, logical thinking in the world. people are much to hasty to support data that supports what they believe already, rather than looking into data that contradicts one's belief. 
you need a balance. you need to look at things from both sides and come to reasonable, rational conclusions. 
when i saw the headline, i assumed this was a link to the onion.
awful title.
i didn't read the whole thing but is it mentioned in the article anywhere exactly how much old growth they are cutting down? for all i know "some" could mean "2 old growth trees".
because the way this halo was detected literally wouldn't work. they discovered it because of how light interacted with the oxygen, hydrogen, and other elements. dark matter can't be seen, and it doesn't interact with light. we can only see it through its' immense gravitation it creates. 
no other element or atom interacts this way, is as massive. the comparisons people try to make between baryonic matter and whatever dark matter is are completely misguided. we have a wonderful description of how every single piece that makes up baryonic matter interacts with each other, and dark matter simply doesn't fit into the hypothesis. 
[here](http://www.nature.com/news/dark-matter-s-tendrils-revealed-1.10951) is a link to proof that dark matter exists. if the literally galactic cluster worth of dark matter that was observed was via gravitational lensing, was in fact baryonic matter, it would be a cluster, not some free-floating, no interacting thing.
hope this helped.
sure isn't.
no.  it is not.
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unconformity)
well if it's not, can you please explain why it isn't?
also, sorry for the typo in the title, but i don't see an option to edit that.  :/
since there is no such thing, no it's not.
i hadn't seen this yet. :d thanks.
this species is particularly snub-nosed.  but there are a lot of other snub-nosed monkey that are not quite so snub-nosed.  so perhaps there is some selective advantage to a snubed nose, but this is an example of evolution run amok:
"according to local hunters, the monkeys, rhinopithecus strykeri, sit with their heads tucked between their knees on drizzly days to keep from inhaling water. when the water gets caught in their noses, they sneeze, locals say. "
i don't know, i remember my overweight classmates being absolutely humiliated by the whole thing. when you're obese, running is not only difficult, but it makes you incredibly self-conscious about your flab bouncing up and down (plus, i've heard it can even hurt). fitness is important, but if we're talking strictly mental health, it's best left at home for obese students. of course, you could argue that it's the only way they'll move at all, but that's placing a lot of assumptions on the kids and their families. 
all i know is i remember vividly the looks on their faces when they had to run. it was heartbreakingly sad. 
i have reported this submission for the following violations of the submission guidelines:
it is not:
&gt;a direct link to or a summary of peer reviewed research with appropriate citations.
nor did op:
&gt;if the article itself does not link to these sources, please include a link in a comment.
the article cites action by non-scientific forestry and environmental action groups, not scientific entities or agencies.
&gt;recent scientific research. the research linked to should be within the past 6 months (or so).
this submission is non-scientific and does not add to the discussion of science issues.
makes sense.
&gt;if the gas is equivalent to less then 10 percent of the milk way's total mass then some mass is still missing.
you assume that *all* baryonic matter that was missing has to be inside this halo. i personally don't know if current theories for the missing baryonic matter include black holes, but i'll go ahead and assume that some is taken in from those, and that *some*, but not all missing matter are located in voids.
or, the theory could be incorrect. i don't really know.
this is very basic, and i don't have enough time to watch the vid but here goes. a perpetual motion machine could go on forever without you helping it in any way.
that thing is on earth, earth has an atmosphere... that atmosphere creates friction which saps energy from whatever is happening. friction, by doing this and pretty much every machine into non-perpetual motion.
no
nonsense, lets send captain kirk, science officer spock, chief engineer mccoy, and ensign smith down to investigate. 
no, it's dead...  i guess they got it from some hunters.
it's mechanical, so there is friction. to overcome the friction takes energy. to continue doing whatever the hell it does would produce energy from nothing. energy from nothing is a no-no.
hence why we need unobtanium drill bits-- durable, can reach the mantle, maybe the core perhaps and come back, and generate power from heat so it's a thermoelectric material as well.
:d
wow...  i can't believe this guy isn't in obama's cabinet.  this is central planning at its best.
i assume this study was conducted by the same scientists who confirmed that hip bone is, in fact, connected to the leg bone?
thank you.  here is a shorter clip i found.

they use wood in ikea furniture?
an age gap were we being honest. he said in a pm he's writing his thesis(i assume for graduate school). i'm 16. so there's a little bit of a difference in what we've been taught. :(
this is really awesome
you're getting slammed because you are arguing politics in /r/science.
i agree with you, no politician is going to push for more regulation on the cattle industry because his opponents will spin it as "he was responsible for the increase in your grocery bill." the problem lies in the fact that politicians run the political scene, and what we need are leaders. it sounds trite, but a leader would be the one pushing for the necessary unpopular opinion; but that isn't going to happen anywhere close to an election season.
the majority of the readers here want a literate electorate and a literate government, but we don't have that. the people downvoting you aren't recognizing that you have to work with what you've got, and that is(was) oprah saying "cattle-antibiotics are bad!"
to answer your question, removing wolves from the endangered species list and shifting wolf population control to the state level has been a hot topic among hunters, ranchers, and environmentalists the past few years, that's why they are writing these articles.
i don't consider myself to be a dumb person, but as an avid hunter and hiker, i've always questioned the necessity of wolves and other top level predators in our ecosystem because humans are top level predators. our state wildlife department strategically uses hunters to control local animal populations to prevent overpopulation leading to famine and disease. this article uses yellowstone as an example of how wolves are good for the ecosystem, however hunting is not allowed in the park, so of course the effects of grazers on the local ecosystem is going to be detrimental. i understand my view on this is a little biased, as i don't want to compete with wolves for food, and a wolf is the last thing i want to run in to while hiking. i've always told myself that humans have just replaced wolves as the dominant predator.
i still think that wolves and humans coexisting in great numbers causes a lot of problems, as is shown in the pack of wolves reintroduced in washington state becoming dependent on cattle herds. however, this article has shed some light on the subject for me.
i understand that i'm in no way a biologist, and most of the above is my personal opinion.
we solved the problems the russians faced in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kola_superdeep_borehole) project?  
i was wondering when i would see a collection of reactions to this study.  it's just too bad that the greater public won't ever hear about these reactions, since the mass media has already been scarred enough by the original study, and by gmos in general.
be right back, gonna burn all my ikea furtniture in protest.
i haven't said anything near "gloom and doom". 
which ones are you refering to and where were they?
i think the point of this article is where they were found. the previous migration models had modern humans reaching this part of the world later than this finding suggests.
yes. more work needs to be done on the stabilization of these elements before we can efficiently study them.
powerful graham hancock
i definitely don't mean they were as advanced as us, or anywhere near (at least not technologically). i don't really like using the term 'advanced civilization' because people have these preconceived images already in their head. the people who built places like gobekli tepe (i use this example because i believe it is the most well known out of the relatively recently discoveries) were not just mere hunters/gatherers as suggested, hunter/gatherers have no reason to construct these massive structures, unless they planned on staying there for long periods of time. 
don't get me wrong, i'm not suggesting that there were these highly advanced people that we can't even comprehend, but we have found architectural structures in recent years that we don't even have the technology to recreate. i just don't think we give our ancestors nearly enough credit and have a tendency to just write them off as "stupid" and "uncivilized"
&gt;what would be left of our civilization 65,000 years from now
plastic and spent nuclear fuel.  giant empty chasms under ground where oil used to be.  underground bunkers not subject to erosion.  space junk possibly orbiting the earth.
i think it would be pretty obvious that we were here and advanced.
salmonella is literally shitty.  spending a week in a hospital pulling an iv cart back and forth from the bathroom to spew liquid dooky every 10minutes was terrible.  then there is the feeling of your stomach being stabbed with knives. 
super salmonella can kiss my ass.
she did not "just" reinvent space travel, because the story is from [may](http://www.fastcompany.com/1837966/mustafas-space-drive-egyptian-students-quantum-physics-invention).
that puts things into perspective.  you're doing far better than most people your age.  in fact far better than most people period.
i think he has two points which are still disputed that i honestly can't see how people still refute. 
#1 his map theory
#2 the theory of the age of sphinx
sorry, you were talking about 40 foot sea level rise...i lump that in with gloom and doom.  
it would probably be nigerium, pronounced niger-e-um
but you're race baiting by adding a second 'r'
what's with all the attacks on ikea lately?
every piece of ikea furniture i've boughy was made with what i think they call "sandwhich" board or whatever...basically extremely cheap wood product.
i guess the old growth trees could be processed in such a way but even then im sure people would notice the jump in quality
the date on the op's link is 5/31/2012.
but thanks for submitting the more contextual article.
my first thought is burkitt's lymphoma. 
mdr and xdr tb. i had a patient walk in with active tb. hemoptysis, weight loss, the usual. i am thankful that i was neither infected nor was it xdr. 
i imagine that this will be the cycle we will have to endure in today's world: knee jerk media reactions to bad science and general public ignorance until the damage is gradually undone by refuting studies. same thing with vaccines being erroneously linked to autism.  is it bad that this happens? yes. but that's the reality of the world we live and we can only work hard to educate people.  i'm no real fan of monsanto, but we can't stop research into methods for feeding our ever growing population just because 1 company doing research in the field is creepy.
well shit
yeah, i agree that in the aggregate, the timeline gets pushed earlier.
having an opinion about a specific country while living in that country has nothing to do with credibility.
only going to respond to the stuff relevant to post topic this time(that means ignoring the math subject, and interpretation, etc), sadly have to study for a spanish test.
anyways;
i was wrong about the nucleogenic definition, it appears i just read it wrong. my bad.
&gt;nothing here is implied about dark matter
see, i don't get it when you say things like that, but also say:
&gt;there is one more thing to note here: dark matter is thought to be comprised of only a little bit of the stuff we see in the halo of our galaxy.
if dark matter is only a little bit of the stuff that we see in our halo then this is making a direct ontological commitment that dark matter is a.) simultaneously two things (as opposed to one thing only) b.) part non-baryonic c.) part baryonic.
i think i've stated that incorrectly. a more accurate thing to say would be:
&gt;baryonic matter caused gravity would only be a small part of the much large non-baryonic matter caused gravity. 
they are two distinct things, dm and bm. bm is obviously the matter that makes up you and me, from protons, neutrons, etc, but dm is made up of something altogether different, something that doesn't interact with any of the forces other than gravity.
